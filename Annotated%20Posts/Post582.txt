I	O
think	O
learning	O

program	O
because	O
you	O

never	O
be	O

good	O
as	O
learning	O

something	O

If	O
you	O

something	O
that	O
your	O
brother	O

he	O

it	O

you	O

him	O

he	O

I	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
problems	O
with	O
teaching	O
programming	O
in	O
the	O
abstract	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
got	O
a	O
real-world	O
context	O
that	O
the	O
learner	O
can	O
get	O
emotionally	O
invested	O
in	O
.	O
Programming	O
is	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
some	O
real	O
payoff	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
worth	O
the	O
effort	O
of	O
doing	O
it	O
.	O
In	O
my	O
case	O
,	O
I	O
'd	O
done	O
computer	O
science	O
at	O
uni	O
,	O
learned	O
Pascal	O
and	O
COBOL	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
learned	O
BASIC	B
at	O
home	O
before	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
never	O
really	O
got	O
anywhere	O
with	O
it	O
until	O
I	O
became	O
a	O
self-employed	O
web	O
designer	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
90s	O
and	O
my	O
clients	O
needed	O
functionality	O
on	O
their	O
web	O
sites	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
pay	O
about	O
10x	O
more	O
for	O
functionality	O
than	O
for	O
design	O

Putting	O

I	O
