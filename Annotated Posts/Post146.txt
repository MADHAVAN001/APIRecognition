The	O
application	O
my	O
team	O
is	O
currently	O
developing	O
has	O
a	O
DLL	O
that	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
perform	O
all	O
database	O
access	O
.	O
The	O
application	O
can	O
not	O
use	O
a	O
trusted	O
connection	O
because	O
the	O
database	O
is	O
behind	O
a	O
firewall	O
and	O
the	O
domain	O
server	O
is	O
not	O
.	O
So	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
connection	O
string	O
needs	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
DB	O
username	O
and	O
password	O
.	O
The	O
DLL	O
currently	O
has	O
the	O
database	O
connection	O
string	O
hard	O
coded	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
when	O
we	O
launch	O
as	O
the	O
assembly	O
can	O
be	O
disassembled	O
and	O
the	O
username	O
and	O
password	O
would	O
be	O
right	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
.	O
One	O
of	O
the	O
requirements	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
password	O
needs	O
to	O
be	O
changed	O
once	O
every	O
few	O
months	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
would	O
need	O
to	O
roll	O
that	O
out	O
to	O
our	O
internal	O
user	O
base	O
.	O
Is	O
there	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
store	O
the	O
password	O
encrypted	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
we	O
can	O
easily	O
distribute	O
to	O
the	O
entire	O
user	O
base	O
without	O
storing	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
assembly	O
?	O
