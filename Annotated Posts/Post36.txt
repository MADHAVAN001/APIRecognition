So	O
my	O
company	O
stores	O
alot	O
of	O
data	O
in	O
a	O
foxpro	O
database	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
around	O
the	O
performance	O
hit	O
of	O
touching	O
it	O
directly	O
I	O
was	O
thinking	O
of	O
messaging	O
anything	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
done	O
asynchronously	O
for	O
a	O
snappier	O
user	O
experience	O
.	O
I	O
started	O
looking	O
at	O
ActiveMQ	O
but	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
how	O
well	O
C	O
#	O
will	O
hook	O
with	O
it	O
.	O
Wanting	O
to	O
hear	O
what	O
all	O
of	O
you	O
guys	O
think	O
.	O
edit	O
:	O
It	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
web	O
application	O
.	O
Anything	O
touching	O
this	O
foxpro	O
is	O
kinda	O
slow	O
(	O
probably	O
because	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
10	O
years	O
ago	O
messed	O
it	O
all	O
to	O
hell	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
table	O
files	O
are	O
incredibly	O
large	O
)	O
.	O
We	O
replicate	O
the	O
foxpro	O
to	O
sql	O
nightly	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
data	O
reads	O
are	O
ok	O
being	O
a	O
day	O
old	O
so	O
we	O
are	O
focusing	O
on	O
the	O
writes	O
.	O
plus	O
the	O
write	O
affects	O
a	O
critical	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
user	O
experience	O
(	O
purchasing	O
)	O
,	O
we	O
store	O
it	O
in	O
sql	O
and	O
then	O
just	O
message	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
put	O
into	O
foxpro	O
when	O
it	O
can	O
.	O
I	O
wish	O
we	O
could	O
just	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
foxpro	O
,	O
unfortunately	O
the	O
company	O
does	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
old	O
piece	O
of	O
software	O
they	O
bought	O
that	O
depends	O
on	O
it	O
.	O
