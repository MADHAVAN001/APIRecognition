is	O
indeed	O
a	O
hot	O
topic	O
for	O
researchers	O
in	O
that	O
field	O

but	O
only	O
begun	O
to	O
grow	O
out	O
of	O
control	O
when	O
captcha	O
's	O
became	O
the	O
``	O

''	O
in	O

of	O

against	O

Why	O
use	O
captcha	O
's	O
as	O
protection	O
?	O
well	O
because	O
it	O
is/was	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
locate	O
(	O

read	O
)	O
text	O
inside	O
an	O
image	O
!	O
The	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
mention	O
captcha	O
's	O
is	O
because	O
the	O
most	O
advancement*	O
is	O
made	O
within	O
that	O
tiny	O
area	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
your	O
solution	O
could	O
be	O
best	O
found	O
there	O
.	O
especially	O
because	O
captcha	O
's	O
are	O
indeed	O
about	O
locating	O
text	O
(	O
or	O
something	O
that	O
resembles	O
text	O
)	O
inside	O
a	O
cluttered	O
image	O
and	O
afterwards	O
trying	O
to	O
read	O
the	O

so	O
if	O
you	O

find	O
yourself	O
a	O

you	O

all	O

your	O

You	O
could	O

even	O
throw	O
away	O
the	O

that	O

the	O
