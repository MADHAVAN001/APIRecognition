you	O

all	O

to	O
(	O
in	O
VB.NET	O

once	O
you	O
have	O
finished	O
with	O
them	O
?	O
I	O
understand	O
that	O
in	O
.NET	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
any	O
instances	O
of	O
objects	O
that	O
implement	O
the	O

release	O
some	O

although	O
the	O

can	O
still	O
be	O
something	O
after	O
it	O
is	O
disposed	O
(	O
hence	O
the	O
property	O
in	O

,	O
so	O
I	O
assume	O
it	O

still	O
reside	O
in	O
memory	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
in	O
part	O
?	O
I	O
also	O
know	O
that	O
when	O
an	O
object	O
goes	O
out	O

scope	O
it	O
is	O
then	O
marked	O
for	O
collection	O

this	O

So	O
with	O
this	O
