I	O
have	O
a	O
client-server	O
app	O
where	O
the	O
client	O
is	O
on	O
a	O
Windows	O
Mobile	O
6	O
device	O
,	O
written	O
in	O
C++	O
and	O
the	O
server	O
is	O
on	O
full	O
Windows	O
and	O
written	O
in	O
C	O
#	O
.	O
Originally	O
,	O
I	O
only	O
needed	O
it	O
to	O
send	O
messages	O
from	O
the	O
client	O
to	O
the	O
server	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
server	O
only	O
ever	O
sending	O
back	O
an	O
acknowledgment	O
that	O
it	O
received	O
the	O
message	O
.	O
Now	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
update	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
server	O
can	O
actually	O
send	O
a	O
message	O
to	O
the	O
client	O
to	O
request	O
data	O
.	O
As	O
I	O
currently	O
have	O
it	O
set	O
up	O
so	O
the	O
client	O
is	O
only	O
in	O
receive	O
mode	O
after	O
it	O
sends	O
data	O
to	O
the	O
server	O
,	O
this	O
does	O
n't	O
allow	O
for	O
the	O
server	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
request	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
.	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
client	O
data	O
.	O
My	O
first	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
create	O
another	O
thread	O
on	O
the	O
client	O
with	O
a	O
separate	O
open	O
socket	O
,	O
listening	O
for	O
server	O
requests	O
...	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
server	O
already	O
has	O
in	O
respect	O
the	O
the	O
client	O
.	O
Is	O
there	O
a	O
way	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
same	O
thread	O
and	O
using	O
the	O
same	O
socket	O
,	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
server	O
to	O
send	O
requests	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
?	O
Can	O
you	O
use	O
something	O
to	O
the	O
affect	O
of	O
WaitForMultipleObjects	O
(	O
)	O
and	O
pass	O
it	O
a	O
receive	O

an	O
event	O
