On	O
a	O
recent	O
Java	O
project	O
,	O
we	O
needed	O
a	O
free	O
Java	O
based	O
real-time	O
data	O
plotting	O
utility	O
.	O
After	O
much	O
searching	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
this	O
tool	O
called	O
the	O
Scientific	O
Graphics	O
Toolkit	O
or	O
SGT	O
from	O
NOAA	O
.	O
It	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
robust	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
out	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
terribly	O
configurable	O
.	O
Or	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
configurable	O
enough	O
to	O
meet	O
our	O
needs	O
.	O
We	O
ended	O
up	O
digging	O
very	O
deeply	O
into	O
the	O
Java	O
code	O
and	O
reverse	O
engineering	O
the	O
code	O
and	O
changing	O
it	O
all	O
around	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
plot	O
tool	O
look	O
and	O
act	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
wanted	O
it	O
to	O
look	O
and	O
act	O
.	O
Of	O
course	O
,	O
this	O
killed	O
any	O
chance	O
for	O
future	O
upgrades	O
from	O
NOAA	O

So	O
what	O
free	O
or	O
cheap	O
Java	O

data	O

tools	O
or	O
libraries	O
do	O
you	O

Thanks	O
for	O
the	O

I	O

out	O

it	O
looks	O

a	O
very	O
nice	O
data	O

utility	O

I	O
should	O

made	O
it	O
clear	O
in	O
my	O
original	O
question	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
looking	O
specifically	O
to	O
plot	O
real-time	O

I	O
corrected	O
my	O
question	O
above	O
to	O

that	O

It	O
appears	O
that	O
JFreeChart	O

is	O
