generally	CODE

maybe	CODE
it's	CODE
good	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE

the	CODE

i	CODE
found	CODE
bpgsql	CODE
really	CODE
good	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE

it's	CODE
a	CODE

for	CODE

most	CODE
often	CODE
used	CODE

personally	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE

what	CODE

you	CODE

the	CODE

excited	CODE
about	CODE

as	CODE

-	CODE
the	CODE

would	CODE
lock	CODE

i'd	CODE

to	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE

nothing	CODE

a	CODE

move	CODE

even	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
pro	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
testing	CODE
suite	CODE
so	CODE
i'll	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
these	CODE
options	CODE
i've	CODE
just	CODE
started	CODE
using	CODE
visual	CODE
studioaspnetc#	CODE
this	CODE
summer	CODE
possible	CODE
duplicate	CODE
casting	CODE
vs	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
as	CODE
keyword	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
clr	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
these	CODE
two	CODE
casts	CODE
normally	CODE
they	CODE
should	CODE
both	CODE
be	CODE
explicit	CODE
casts	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
specified	CODE
type	CODE
i	CODE
often	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
sort	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
consisting	CODE
of	CODE
keys	CODE
values	CODE
by	CODE
value	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
hash	CODE
of	CODE
words	CODE
and	CODE
respective	CODE
frequencies	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
order	CODE
by	CODE
frequency	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
sortedlist	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
value	CODE
say	CODE
frequency	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
map	CODE
it	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
word	CODE
sorteddictionary	CODE
orders	CODE
by	CODE
key	CODE
not	CODE
value	CODE
some	CODE
resort	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
class	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
cleaner	CODE
way	CODE
why	CODE
are	CODE
unsigned	CODE
integers	CODE
not	CODE
cls	CODE
compliant	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
starting	CODE
to	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
specification	CODE
is	CODE
just	CODE
for	CODE
performance	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
for	CODE
correctness	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
track-bar	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
a	CODE
form's	CODE
opacity	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
this	CODE
error	CODE
cannot	CODE
implicitly	CODE
convert	CODE
type	CODE
'decimal'	CODE
to	CODE
'double'	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
making	CODE
trans	CODE
a	CODE
double	CODE
but	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
doesn't	CODE
work	CODE
this	CODE
code	CODE
has	CODE
worked	CODE
fine	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
in	CODE
vbnet	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
simplest	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
connect	CODE
and	CODE
query	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
records	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
jbutton	CODE
with	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
button	CODE
graphic	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
button	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
another	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
button	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
insert	CODE
an	CODE
escape	CODE
character	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
table	CODE
results	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
warning	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
produces	CODE
the	CODE
warning	CODE
using	CODE
psql	CODE

anyone	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
around	CODE
this	CODE
i'm	CODE
developing	CODE
a	CODE
sharepoint	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
net	CODE
ajaxcontroltoolkit	CODE
library	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
aspx	CODE
page	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
sharepoint	CODE
sharepoint	CODE
2007	CODE
run	CODE
in	CODE
quirks	CODE
mode	CODE
so	CODE
i've	CODE
made	CODE
some	CODE
modification	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
ajax	CODE
library	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
behave	CODE
like	CODE
it	CODE
normally	CODE
should	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
team	CODE
already	CODE
use	CODE
ajax	CODE
library	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
version	CODE
with	CODE
mine	CODE
this	CODE
cause	CODE
conflict	CODE
because	CODE
there	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
only	CODE
one	CODE
dll	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
bin	CODE
folder	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
name	CODE
from	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
net	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
this	CODE
situation	CODE
easily	CODE
i've	CODE
tried	CODE
using	CODE
strong	CODE
name	CODE
and	CODE
gac	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
still	CODE
refer	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
dll	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
bin	CODE
folder	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
ajaxcontroltoolkitdll	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
bin	CODE
folder	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
will	CODE
simply	CODE
fail	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
assembly	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
complete	CODE
assembly	CODE
information	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
it	CODE
gives	CODE
me	CODE
compiler	CODE
error	CODE
cs0433	CODE
can	CODE
someone	CODE
help	CODE
me	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
multiple	CODE
version	CODE
of	CODE
assembly	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
anyway	CODE
to	CODE
configure	CODE
a	CODE
wcf	CODE
service	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
failover	CODE
endpoint	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
primary	CODE
endpoint	CODE
dies	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
like	CODE
being	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
specify	CODE
a	CODE
failover	CODE
server	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
sql	CODE
cluster	CODE
specifically	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
tcpip	CODE
binding	CODE
for	CODE
speed	CODE
but	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
rare	CODE
occurrence	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
machine	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
available	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
redirect	CODE
traffic	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
failover	CODE
server	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
bothered	CODE
about	CODE
losing	CODE
messages	CODE
i'd	CODE
just	CODE
prefer	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
re-routing	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
help	CODE
finishing	CODE
my	CODE
custom	CODE
built	CODE
ajax	CODE
[div]	CODE
based	CODE
dynamic	CODE
dropdown	CODE
basically	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
[input]	CODE
box	CODE
which	CODE
onkeyup	CODE
runs	CODE
an	CODE
ajax	CODE
search	CODE
which	CODE
returns	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
results	CODE
in	CODE
divs	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
drawn	CODE
back	CODE
in	CODE
using	CODE
innerhtml	CODE
these	CODE
divs	CODE
all	CODE
have	CODE
highlights	CODE
onmouseover	CODE
so	CODE
a	CODE
typical	CODE
successfull	CODE
search	CODE
yields	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
structure	CODE
pardon	CODE
the	CODE
semicode	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
beautifully	CODE
looks	CODE
elegant	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
way	CODE
more	CODE
complete	CODE
than	CODE
any	CODE
regular	CODE
dropdown	CODE
those	CODE
results	CODE
div	CODE
bring	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
information	CODE
however	CODE
i'm	CODE
missing	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
important	CODE
functions	CODE
behind	CODE
regular	CODE
html	CODE
elements	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
keyboard	CODE
down	CODE
or	CODE
up	CODE
between	CODE
options	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
javascript	CODE
handles	CODE
keyboard	CODE
events	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
guide	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
the	CODE
follow	CODE
up	CODE
question	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
eventually	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
being	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
enter	CODE
to	CODE
trigger	CODE
that	CODE
onclick	CODE
event	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
win32's	CODE
messagebox	CODE
using	CODE
gtk	CODE
the	CODE
app	CODE
using	CODE
sdlopengl	CODE
so	CODE
this	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
gtk	CODE
app	CODE
i	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
initialisation	CODE
gtk_init	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
stuff	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
messagebox	CODE
function	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
by	CODE
no	CODE
means	CODE
an	CODE
experienced	CODE
gtk	CODE
programmer	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
realise	CODE
that	CODE
i'm	CODE
probably	CODE
doing	CODE
somethings	CODE
horribly	CODE
wrong	CODE
however	CODE
my	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
dialog	CODE
popped	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
function	CODE
stays	CODE
around	CODE
until	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
exits	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
application	CODE
or	CODE
library	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
allow	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
data	CODE
file	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
file	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
tags	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
provided	CODE
through	CODE
possibly	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
row	CODE
containing	CODE
column	CODE
headings	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
firebug	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
mozilla	CODE
js	CODE
console	CODE
heavily	CODE
but	CODE
every	CODE
now	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
run	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
ie-only	CODE
javascript	CODE
bug	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
really	CODE
hard	CODE
to	CODE
locate	CODE
ex	CODE
error	CODE
on	CODE
line	CODE
724	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
html	CODE
only	CODE
has	CODE
200	CODE
lines	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
love	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
lightweight	CODE
js	CODE
tool	CODE
a	CODE
la	CODE
firebug	CODE
for	CODE
internet	CODE
explorer	CODE
something	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
install	CODE
in	CODE
seconds	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
client's	CODE
pc	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
run	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
error	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
uninstall	CODE
some	CODE
microsoft	CODE
tools	CODE
take	CODE
some	CODE
serious	CODE
download	CODE
and	CODE
configuration	CODE
time	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
purist	CODE
or	CODE
correct	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
an	CODE
object's	CODE
properties	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
method	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
method	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
from	CODE
outside	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
but	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
would	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
do	CODE
java	CODE
php	CODE
or	CODE
would	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
java	CODE
php	CODE
forgive	CODE
me	CODE
if	CODE
my	CODE
java	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
off	CODE
it's	CODE
been	CODE
a	CODE
year	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
programmed	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
edit	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
people	CODE
are	CODE
assuming	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
private	CODE
or	CODE
protected	CODE
variablesproperties	CODE
only	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
oo	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
taught	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
getterssetters	CODE
for	CODE
every	CODE
single	CODE
property	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
public	CODE
and	CODE
actually	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
told	CODE
never	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
any	CODE
variableproperty	CODE
public	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
starting	CODE
off	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
false	CODE
assumption	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
get	CODE
go	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
people	CODE
answering	CODE
this	CODE
question	CODE
are	CODE
maybe	CODE
saying	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
public	CODE
properties	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
those	CODE
don't	CODE
need	CODE
getters	CODE
and	CODE
setters	CODE
which	CODE
goes	CODE
against	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
taught	CODE
and	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
although	CODE
maybe	CODE
that	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
discussed	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
that's	CODE
probably	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
topic	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
question	CODE
though	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
optimal	CODE
level	CODE
of	CODE
concurrency	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
c++	CODE
implementation	CODE
of	CODE
berkeleydb	CODE
can	CODE
reasonably	CODE
support	CODE
how	CODE
many	CODE
threads	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
hammering	CODE
away	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
db	CODE
before	CODE
throughput	CODE
starts	CODE
to	CODE
suffer	CODE
because	CODE
of	CODE
resource	CODE
contention	CODE
i've	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
manual	CODE
and	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
locks	CODE
lockers	CODE
database	CODE
page	CODE
size	CODE
etc	CODE
but	CODE
i'd	CODE
just	CODE
like	CODE
some	CODE
advice	CODE
from	CODE
someone	CODE
who	CODE
has	CODE
real-world	CODE
experience	CODE
with	CODE
bdb	CODE
concurrency	CODE
my	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
simple	CODE
i'll	CODE
be	CODE
doing	CODE
gets	CODE
and	CODE
puts	CODE
of	CODE
records	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
about	CODE
1kb	CODE
each	CODE
no	CODE
cursors	CODE
no	CODE
deleting	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
datatable	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
name	CODE
column	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
unique	CODE
names	CODE
ordered	CODE
alphabetically	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
query	CODE
ignores	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
by	CODE
clause	CODE
why	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
orderby	CODE
not	CODE
get	CODE
enforced	CODE
so	CODE
my	CODE
company	CODE
stores	CODE
alot	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
foxpro	CODE
database	CODE
and	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
performance	CODE
hit	CODE
of	CODE
touching	CODE
it	CODE
directly	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
thinking	CODE
of	CODE
messaging	CODE
anything	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
asynchronously	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
snappier	CODE
user	CODE
experience	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
activemq	CODE
but	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
well	CODE
c#	CODE
will	CODE
hook	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
wanting	CODE
to	CODE
hear	CODE
what	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
you	CODE
guys	CODE
think	CODE
edit	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
anything	CODE
touching	CODE
this	CODE
foxpro	CODE
is	CODE
kinda	CODE
slow	CODE
probably	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
person	CODE
who	CODE
set	CODE
it	CODE
up	CODE
10	CODE
years	CODE
ago	CODE
messed	CODE
it	CODE
all	CODE
to	CODE
hell	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
table	CODE
files	CODE
are	CODE
incredibly	CODE
large	CODE
we	CODE
replicate	CODE
the	CODE
foxpro	CODE
to	CODE
sql	CODE
nightly	CODE
and	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
our	CODE
data	CODE
reads	CODE
are	CODE
ok	CODE
being	CODE
a	CODE
day	CODE
old	CODE
so	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
focusing	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
writes	CODE
plus	CODE
the	CODE
write	CODE
affects	CODE
a	CODE
critical	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
experience	CODE
purchasing	CODE
we	CODE
store	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
sql	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
just	CODE
message	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
it	CODE
put	CODE
into	CODE
foxpro	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
wish	CODE
we	CODE
could	CODE
just	CODE
get	CODE
rid	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
foxpro	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
the	CODE
company	CODE
doesn't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
rid	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
very	CODE
old	CODE
piece	CODE
of	CODE
software	CODE
they	CODE
bought	CODE
that	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
i'm	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
multithreaded	CODE
c++	CODE
application	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
corrupting	CODE
the	CODE
heap	CODE
the	CODE
usual	CODE
tools	CODE
to	CODE
locate	CODE
this	CODE
corruption	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
inapplicable	CODE
old	CODE
builds	CODE
18	CODE
months	CODE
old	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
exhibit	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
behaviour	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
recent	CODE
release	CODE
so	CODE
this	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
around	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
long	CODE
time	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
wasn't	CODE
noticed	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
downside	CODE
source	CODE
deltas	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
identify	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
bug	CODE
was	CODE
introduced	CODE
-	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
changes	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
repository	CODE
the	CODE
prompt	CODE
for	CODE
crashing	CODE
behaviuor	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
throughput	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
system	CODE
-	CODE
socket	CODE
transfer	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
munged	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
internal	CODE
representation	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
test	CODE
data	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
periodically	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
app	CODE
to	CODE
exception	CODE
various	CODE
places	CODE
various	CODE
causes	CODE
-	CODE
including	CODE
heap	CODE
alloc	CODE
failing	CODE
thus	CODE
heap	CODE
corruption	CODE
the	CODE
behaviour	CODE
seems	CODE
related	CODE
to	CODE
cpu	CODE
power	CODE
or	CODE
memory	CODE
bandwidth	CODE
the	CODE
more	CODE
of	CODE
each	CODE
the	CODE
machine	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
easier	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
crash	CODE
disabling	CODE
a	CODE
hyper-threading	CODE
core	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
dual-core	CODE
core	CODE
reduces	CODE
the	CODE
rate	CODE
of	CODE
but	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
eliminate	CODE
corruption	CODE
this	CODE
suggests	CODE
a	CODE
timing	CODE
related	CODE
issue	CODE
now	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
rub	CODE
when	CODE
it's	CODE
run	CODE
under	CODE
a	CODE
lightweight	CODE
debug	CODE
environment	CODE
say	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
98	CODE
aka	CODE
msvc6	CODE
the	CODE
heap	CODE
corruption	CODE
is	CODE
reasonably	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
reproduce	CODE
-	CODE
ten	CODE
or	CODE
fifteen	CODE
minutes	CODE
pass	CODE
before	CODE
something	CODE
fails	CODE
horrendously	CODE
and	CODE
exceptions	CODE
like	CODE
an	CODE
alloc	CODE
when	CODE
running	CODE

i'll	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE

i'm	CODE
concerned	CODE
that	CODE

not	CODE
when	CODE

something	CODE

wrong	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE

maybe	CODE
these	CODE

will	CODE
allow	CODE
you	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
to	CODE
narrow	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
to	CODE
certain	CODE

i	CODE
don't	CODE
hold	CODE

hope	CODE

desperate	CODE
times	CODE

are	CODE
you	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE

no	CODE
i'm	CODE

i'll	CODE
spend	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
hours	CODE
tomorrow	CODE
going	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
workspace	CODE
58	CODE
projects	CODE
in	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
checking	CODE
they're	CODE
all	CODE
compiling	CODE
and	CODE
linking	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
appropriate	CODE
flags	CODE
update	CODE
this	CODE
took	CODE
30	CODE
seconds	CODE
select	CODE
all	CODE
projects	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
dialog	CODE
unselect	CODE
until	CODE
you	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
projects	CODE
that	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
settings	CODE
they	CODE
all	CODE
had	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
settings	CODE
were	CODE
defining	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
module	CODE
to	CODE
outsource	CODE
i	CODE
dont	CODE
like	CODE
it	CODE
either	CODE
maintaining	CODE
and	CODE
evolving	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
inhouse	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
good	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
define	CODE
and	CODE
autocheck	CODE
the	CODE
in-code	CODE
documentation	CODE
quality	CODE
i've	CODE
got	CODE
a	CODE
menu	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
that	CODE
part	CODE
was	CODE
easy	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
raw_input	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
selection	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
raw_input	CODE
and	CODE
input	CODE
require	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
to	CODE
press	CODE
enter	CODE
after	CODE
they	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
selection	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
program	CODE
act	CODE
immediately	CODE
upon	CODE
a	CODE
keystroke	CODE
here's	CODE
what	CODE
i've	CODE
got	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
great	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
running	CODE
a	CODE
tomcat	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
some	CODE
time	CODE
values	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
is	CODE
coming	CODE
up	CODE
an	CODE
hour	CODE
off	CODE
i	CODE
looked	CODE
into	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
discovered	CODE
that	CODE
my	CODE
default	CODE
timezone	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
pacific	CODE
time	CODE
zone	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
further	CODE
indicated	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
print	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
time	CODE
zone's	CODE
display	CODE
name	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
comes	CODE
up	CODE
gmt-0800	CODE
which	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
indicate	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
correctly	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
us	CODE
pacific	CODE
time	CODE
zone	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
running	CODE
on	CODE
ubuntu	CODE
hardy	CODE
heron	CODE
upgraded	CODE
from	CODE
gutsy	CODE
gibbon	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
configuration	CODE
file	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
update	CODE
to	CODE
tell	CODE
the	CODE
jre	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
pacific	CODE
with	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
associated	CODE
daylight	CODE
savings	CODE
time	CODE
information	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
machine	CODE
shows	CODE
correctly	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
an	CODE
os-wide	CODE
misconfiguration	CODE
ok	CODE
here's	CODE
an	CODE
update	CODE
a	CODE
coworker	CODE
suggested	CODE
i	CODE
update	CODE
java_opts	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
etcprofile	CODE
to	CODE
include	CODE
-dusertimezone=uspacific	CODE
which	CODE
worked	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
saw	CODE
catalina_opts	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
updated	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
actually	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
exported	CODE
the	CODE
change	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
variables	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
etcprofile	CODE
a	CODE
reboot	CODE
later	CODE
will	CODE
pick	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
changes	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
golden	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
still	CODE
think	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
solution	CODE
there	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
configuration	CODE
for	CODE
java	CODE
somewhere	CODE
that	CODE
says	CODE
what	CODE
timezone	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
using	CODE
or	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
grabbing	CODE
the	CODE
timezone	CODE
if	CODE
someone	CODE
knows	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
setting	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
awesome	CODE
but	CODE
for	CODE
now	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
decent	CODE
workaround	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
15	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
most	CODE
definitely	CODE
a	CODE
dst	CODE
problem	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
zone	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
daylight	CODE
savings	CODE
my	CODE
belief	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
generically	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
-8	CODE
offset	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
specific	CODE
pacific	CODE
timezone	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
generic	CODE
-8	CODE
offset	CODE
has	CODE
no	CODE
daylight	CODE
savings	CODE
info	CODE
it's	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
not	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
where	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
tell	CODE
java	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
pacific	CODE
time	CODE
zone	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
starts	CODE
up	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
programmatic	CODE
solution	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
configuration	CODE
solution	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
grab	CODE
the	CODE
base64-encoded	CODE
representation	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
obviously	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
available	CODE
until	CODE
fairly	CODE
late	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
request	CODE
lifecycle	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
ok	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
output	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
includes	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
side	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
wepdwujodu0njc5md==	CODE
to	CODE
clarify	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
this	CODE
value	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
rendered	CODE
not	CODE
on	CODE
postback	CODE
eg	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
value	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
sent	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
i'm	CODE
getting	CODE
back	CODE
from	CODE
them	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
expose	CODE
a	CODE
linq	CODE
query	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
asmx	CODE
web	CODE
service	CODE
usually	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
business	CODE
tier	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE
typed	CODE
dataset	CODE
or	CODE
datatable	CODE
which	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
serialized	CODE
for	CODE
transport	CODE
over	CODE
asmx	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
linq	CODE
query	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
populate	CODE
a	CODE
typed	CODE
dataset	CODE
or	CODE
datatable	CODE
via	CODE
a	CODE
linq	CODE
query	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
resultset	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
linq	CODE
query	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
dataset	CODE
or	CODE
datatable	CODE
alternatively	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
linq	CODE
query	CODE
serializeable	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
expose	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
asmx	CODE
web	CODE
service	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
feel	CODE
free	CODE
to	CODE
answer	CODE
for	CODE
other	CODE
languages	CODE
what	CODE
order	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
runtime	CODE
evaluate	CODE
a	CODE
logic	CODE
statement	CODE
example	CODE
which	CODE
statement	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
runtime	CODE
evaluate	CODE
first	CODE
-	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
time	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
would	CODE
ever	CODE
evaluate	CODE
the	CODE
statement	CODE
backwards	CODE
perhaps	CODE
when	CODE
an	CODE
or	CODE
operator	CODE
is	CODE
involved	CODE
is	CODE
known	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
logical	CODE
bitwise	CODE
operator	CODE
and	CODE
will	CODE
always	CODE
evaluate	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE

what	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE
when	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
bitwise	CODE
operator	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
short-circuited	CODE

i've	CODE
found	CODE
many	CODE

that	CODE
talk	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
feel	CODE
these	CODE

don't	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
job	CODE
explaining	CODE
what's	CODE
going	CODE

i	CODE

i	CODE
realize	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
with	CODE

that	CODE
requires	CODE

vice-versa	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
reverse	CODE
eg	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
obviously	CODE
the	CODE
c++	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
unsafe	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
sure	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
quality	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
stream	CODE
data	CODE
when	CODE
reading	CODE
incoming	CODE
data	CODE
but	CODE
for	CODE
outgoing	CODE
data	CODE
is	CODE
super	CODE
quick	CODE
and	CODE
easy	CODE
i've	CODE
opened	CODE
an	CODE
old	CODE
workspace	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
libray	CODE
and	CODE
its	CODE
test	CODE
harness	CODE
it	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
fine	CODE
but	CODE
now	CODE
doesn't	CODE
and	CODE
older	CODE
versions	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
don't	CODE
work	CODE
either	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
errors	CODE
i've	CODE
tried	CODE
recreating	CODE
the	CODE
project	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
causes	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
errors	CODE
too	CODE
nothing	CODE
seems	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
order	CODE
in	CODE
project	CODE
settings	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
generated	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
app	CODE
i've	CODE
stripped	CODE
out	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
files	CODE
and	CODE
got	CODE
it	CODE
down	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
bare	CODE
minimum	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
the	CODE
error	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
post	CODE
the	CODE
project	CODE
as	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
production	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
lnk2001	CODE
linker	CODE
error	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
usually	CODE
means	CODE
i've	CODE
left	CODE
off	CODE
a	CODE
library	CODE
or	CODE
forgot	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
a	CODE
virtual	CODE
function	CODE
however	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
template	CODE
library	CODE
-	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
header	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
listed	CODE
as	CODE
having	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
in	CODE
iocompletionportobj	CODE
doesn't	CODE
actually	CODE
use	CODE
stdstring	CODE
directly	CODE
but	CODE
does	CODE
call	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
commsexception	CODE
accepts	CODE
a	CODE
stdstring	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
getlasterror	CODE
or	CODE
wsagetlasterror	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
mentioned	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
error	CODE
getmessage	CODE
is	CODE
implemented	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
virtual	CODE
function	CODE
so	CODE
other	CODE
classes	CODE
can	CODE
override	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
need	CODE
be	CODE
however	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
has	CODE
made	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
ansi	CODE
version	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
find	CODE
any	CODE
options	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
control	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
suspect	CODE
that	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
but	CODE
since	CODE
there's	CODE
very	CODE
little	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
options	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
library	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
knowing	CODE
for	CODE
sure	CODE
however	CODE
both	CODE
projects	CODE
to	CODE
specify	CODE
_mbcs	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
options	CODE
any	CODE
suggestions	CODE
i've	CODE
lost	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
morning	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
lose	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
afternoon	CODE
too	CODE
this	CODE
gets	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
whatever	CODE
is	CODE
selected	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
dropdown	CODE
menu	CODE
i	CODE
cannot	CODE
however	CODE
find	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
property	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
after	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
text	CODE
that's	CODE
currently	CODE
displayed	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
drop	CODE
down	CODE
menu	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
text	CODE
then	CODE
looked	CODE
at	CODE
w3schools	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
didn't	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
does	CODE
anybody	CODE
here	CODE
know	CODE
for	CODE
those	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
html	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
drop	CODE

i	CODE
currently	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
datatable	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
results	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE

however	CODE
many	CODE
example	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

show	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE

accessing	CODE
the	CODE

there	CODE
any	CODE
advantage	CODE

of	CODE
using	CODE

datatables	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE

there	CODE
are	CODE
several	CODE

is	CODE
the	CODE

my	CODE

i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
even	CODE
possible	CODE
with	CODE
windows	CODE
forms	CODE

i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
component	CODE

a	CODE

dynamically	CODE
load	CODE

instantiates	CODE

the	CODE

if	CODE
the	CODE

just	CODE

the	CODE

does	CODE
the	CODE

when	CODE

to	CODE
fire	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE

in	CODE

the	CODE
exact	CODE
line	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE

our	CODE

well	CODE
the	CODE
just	CODE
fired	CODE

works	CODE
fine	CODE
as	CODE
expected	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE

one	CODE
hasn't	CODE
nothing	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE

no	CODE
luck	CODE
even	CODE

return	CODE
after	CODE
applicationrun	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
fun	CODE
parts	CODE
of	CODE
multi-cultural	CODE
programming	CODE
is	CODE
number	CODE
formats	CODE
americans	CODE
use	CODE
1000050	CODE
germans	CODE
use	CODE
1000050	CODE
french	CODE
use	CODE
10	CODE
00050	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
approach	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
take	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
parse	CODE
it	CODE
backwards	CODE
until	CODE
i	CODE
encounter	CODE
a	CODE
separator	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
as	CODE
my	CODE
decimal	CODE
separator	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
obvious	CODE
flaw	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
10000	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
interpreted	CODE
as	CODE
10	CODE
another	CODE
approach	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
contains	CODE
2	CODE
different	CODE
non-numeric	CODE
characters	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
one	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
decimal	CODE
separator	CODE
and	CODE
discard	CODE
the	CODE
others	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
only	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
check	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
occurs	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
once	CODE
and	CODE
discard	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
only	CODE
appears	CODE
once	CODE
check	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
3	CODE
digits	CODE
after	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
yes	CODE
discard	CODE
it	CODE
otherwise	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
decimal	CODE
separator	CODE
the	CODE
obvious	CODE
best	CODE
solution	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
detect	CODE
the	CODE
user's	CODE
culture	CODE
or	CODE
browser	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
work	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
frenchman	CODE
using	CODE
an	CODE
en-us	CODE
windowsbrowser	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
framework	CODE
contain	CODE
some	CODE
mythical	CODE
black	CODE
magic	CODE
floating	CODE
point	CODE
parser	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
than	CODE
doubletryparse	CODE
in	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
auto-detect	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
format	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
find	CODE
myself	CODE
porting	CODE
a	CODE
game	CODE
that	CODE
was	CODE
originally	CODE
written	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
to	CODE
linux	CODE
well	CODE
porting	CODE
the	CODE
os	CODE
x	CODE
port	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
port	CODE
to	CODE
linux	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
implemented	CODE
queryperformancecounter	CODE
by	CODE
giving	CODE
the	CODE
useconds	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
start	CODE
up	CODE
this	CODE
coupled	CODE
with	CODE
queryperformancefrequency	CODE
giving	CODE
a	CODE
constant	CODE
1000000	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
frequency	CODE
works	CODE
well	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
machine	CODE
giving	CODE
me	CODE
a	CODE
64	CODE
bit	CODE
variable	CODE
that	CODE
contains	CODE
useconds	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
program's	CODE
start	CODE
up	CODE
so	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
portable	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
discover	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
differently	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
kernel	CODE
was	CODE
compiled	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
way	CODE
or	CODE
anything	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
fine	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
being	CODE
non-portable	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
other	CODE
than	CODE
linux	CODE
however	CODE
which	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
performance	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
seen	CODE
method	CODE
two	CODE
implemented	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
with	CODE
huge	CODE
performance	CODE
gains	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
unable	CODE
to	CODE
measure	CODE
any	CODE
gain	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
was	CODE
wondering	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
already	CODE
does	CODE
method	CODE
2	CODE
even	CODE
when	CODE
written	CODE
like	CODE
method	CODE
1	CODE
the	CODE
theory	CODE
behind	CODE
method	CODE
2	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
datatablerowscount	CODE
on	CODE
every	CODE
iteration	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
simple	CODE
access	CODE
the	CODE
int	CODE
c	CODE
method	CODE
1	CODE
method	CODE
2	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
articles	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
via	CODE
google	CODE
are	CODE
either	CODE
obsolete	CODE
or	CODE
contradict	CODE
one	CODE
another	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
easiest	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
print	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
or	CODE
say	CODE
a	CODE
richtextbox	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it's	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
printdiaglog	CODE
class	CODE
by	CODE
setting	CODE
the	CODE
document	CODE
but	CODE
how	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
get	CODE
converted	CODE
sql	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
binary	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
and	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
python	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
take	CODE
4	CODE
bytes	CODE
and	CODE
convert	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
precision	CODE
floating	CODE
point	CODE
number	CODE
i'm	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
convince	CODE
my	CODE
providers	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
ant	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
rational	CODE
application	CODE
development	CODE
so	CODE
anyone	CODE
can	CODE
recompile	CODE
recheck	CODE
redeploy	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
anyplace	CODE
anytime	CODE
anyhow	CODE
p	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
a	CODE
buildxml	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
that	CODE
generates	CODE
a	CODE
jar	CODE
file	CODE
but	CODE
stopped	CODE
there	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
real	CODE
examples	CODE
to	CODE
compare	CODE
notes	CODE
my	CODE
good	CODE
friends	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
anyone	CODE
close	CODE
to	CODE
chat	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
my	CODE
buildxml	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
*	CODE
i	CODE
edited	CODE
my	CODE
question	CODE
based	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
suggestion	CODE
of	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
pastebinca	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
mac	CODE
address	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
via	CODE
ie	CODE
activex	CODE
objects	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
in	CODE
all	CODE
browsers	CODE
especially	CODE
since	CODE
ff	CODE
is	CODE
gaining	CODE
browser	CODE
share	CODE
everyday	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
manipulate	CODE
a	CODE
large	CODE
10^7	CODE
nodes	CODE
graph	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
corresponding	CODE
to	CODE
each	CODE
nodeedge	CODE
is	CODE
minimal	CODE
say	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
strings	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
efficient	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
memory	CODE
and	CODE
speed	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
dict	CODE
of	CODE
dicts	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
flexible	CODE
and	CODE
simpler	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
intuitively	CODE
expect	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
lists	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
faster	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
option	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
require	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
keep	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
separate	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
structure	CODE
while	CODE
dicts	CODE
would	CODE
allow	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
sort	CODE
what	CODE
would	CODE
you	CODE
suggest	CODE
yes	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
clearer	CODE
on	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
by	CODE
efficiency	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
particular	CODE
case	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
random	CODE
access	CODE
retrieval	CODE
loading	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
in	CODE
to	CODE
memory	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
huge	CODE
problem	CODE
that's	CODE
done	CODE
once	CODE
and	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
consuming	CODE
part	CODE
is	CODE
visiting	CODE
the	CODE
nodes	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
extract	CODE
the	CODE
information	CODE
and	CODE
measure	CODE
the	CODE
metrics	CODE
i'm	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
i	CODE
hadn't	CODE
considered	CODE
making	CODE
each	CODE
node	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
properties	CODE
are	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
nodes	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
add	CODE
an	CODE
extra	CODE
layer	CODE
of	CODE
overhead	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
hoping	CODE
someone	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
direct	CODE
experience	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
similar	CODE
case	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
could	CODE
share	CODE
after	CODE
all	CODE
graphs	CODE
are	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
common	CODE
abstractions	CODE
in	CODE
cs	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
swing	CODE
back	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
day	CODE
but	CODE
now	CODE
i've	CODE
moved	CODE
to	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
some	CODE
apps	CODE
with	CODE
guis	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
had	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
gui	CODE
api	CODE
so	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
using	CODE
jython	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
prefer	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
cpython	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
great	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
simple	CODE
markup	CODE
that	CODE
allows	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
switch	CODE
gui	CODE
libraries	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
even	CODE
better	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
markup	CODE
language	CODE
across	CODE
languages	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
quickly	CODE
make	CODE
guis	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
language	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
markuplibrary	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
markups	CODE
like	CODE
glade	CODE
and	CODE
wxwidget's	CODE
markup	CODE
i	CODE
forget	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
they're	CODE
partly	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
making	CODE
a	CODE
gui	CODE
without	CODE
coding	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
but	CODE
they're	CODE
intertwined	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
library	CODE
and	CODE
neither	CODE
are	CODE
really	CODE
nice	CODE
looking	CODE
or	CODE
friendly	CODE

remedy	CODE

add	CODE
the	CODE

my	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
or	CODE
consuming	CODE
page	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
some	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
effectively	CODE
hide	CODE
inherited	CODE
members	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
library	CODE
of	CODE
classes	CODE
which	CODE
inherit	CODE
from	CODE
common	CODE
base	CODE
classes	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
more	CODE
recent	CODE
descendant	CODE
classes	CODE
inherit	CODE
dependency	CODE
properties	CODE
which	CODE
have	CODE
become	CODE
vestigial	CODE
and	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
confusing	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
intellisense	CODE
or	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
classes	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
visual	CODE
designer	CODE
these	CODE
classes	CODE
are	CODE
all	CODE
controls	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
written	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
compiled	CODE
for	CODE
either	CODE
wpf	CODE
or	CODE
silverlight	CODE
20	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
about	CODE
icustomtypedescriptor	CODE
and	CODE
icustompropertyprovider	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
pretty	CODE
certain	CODE
those	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
silverlight	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
a	CODE
functional	CODE
issue	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
usability	CODE
issue	CODE
what	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
update	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
properties	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
really	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
hide	CODE
come	CODE
from	CODE
ancestors	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
and	CODE
because	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
tool	CODE
i'm	CODE
designing	CODE
for	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
do	CODE
member	CODE
hiding	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
operator	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
it's	CODE
ridiculous	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
building	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
page	CODE
to	CODE
show	CODE
a	CODE
customer	CODE
what	CODE
software	CODE
they	CODE
purchased	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
give	CODE
them	CODE
a	CODE
link	CODE
to	CODE
download	CODE
said	CODE
software	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
on	CODE
what	CODE
was	CODE
purchased	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
download	CODE
information	CODE
are	CODE
in	CODE
separate	CODE
databases	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
just	CODE
take	CODE
care	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
joins	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
query	CODE
the	CODE
common	CODE
item	CODE
is	CODE
sku	CODE
i'll	CODE
be	CODE
pulling	CODE
back	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
skus	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
customer	CODE
purchases	CODE
database	CODE
and	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
download	CODE
table	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
comma	CODE
delineated	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
skus	CODE
associated	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
download	CODE
my	CODE
intention	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
moment	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
from	CODE
this	CODE
one	CODE
datatable	CODE
to	CODE
populate	CODE
a	CODE
gridview	CODE
any	CODE
suggestions	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
efficiently	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
appreciated	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
helps	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
pretty	CODE
easily	CODE
pull	CODE
back	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
dataset	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
datareader	CODE
if	CODE
either	CODE
one	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
better	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
purpose	CODE
basically	CODE
i've	CODE
written	CODE
an	CODE
api	CODE
to	CODE
wwwthetvdbcom	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
code	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
found	CODE
here	CODE
it	CODE
grabs	CODE
data	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
as	CODE
requested	CODE
and	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
somehow	CODE
and	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
available	CODE
by	CODE
doing	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
abstract	CODE
this	CODE
data	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
tvdb	CODE
class	CODE
i	CODE
originally	CODE
used	CODE
a	CODE
extended	CODE
dict	CODE
that	CODE
automatically	CODE
created	CODE
sub-dicts	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
x[1][2][3][4]	CODE
=	CODE
something	CODE
without	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
if	CODE
x[1]has_key2	CODE
x[1][2]	CODE
=	CODE
[]	CODE
and	CODE
so	CODE
on	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
stored	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
by	CODE
doing	CODE
selfdata[show_id][season_number][episode_number][attribute_name]	CODE
=	CODE
something	CODE
this	CODE
worked	CODE
okay	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
no	CODE
easy	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
checking	CODE
if	CODE
x[3][24]	CODE
was	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
exist	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
couldn't	CODE
raise	CODE
the	CODE
season_not_found	CODE
exception	CODE
currently	CODE
it's	CODE
using	CODE
four	CODE
classes	CODE
showcontainer	CODE
show	CODE
season	CODE
and	CODE
episode	CODE
each	CODE
one	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
very	CODE
basic	CODE
dict	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
easily	CODE
add	CODE
extra	CODE
functionality	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
search	CODE
function	CODE
on	CODE
show	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
each	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
__setitem__	CODE
__getitem_	CODE
and	CODE
has_key	CODE
this	CODE
works	CODE
mostly	CODE
fine	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
check	CODE
in	CODE
shows	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
that	CODE
season	CODE
in	CODE
it's	CODE
selfdata	CODE
dict	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
raise	CODE
season_not_found	CODE
check	CODE
in	CODE
season	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
that	CODE
episode	CODE
and	CODE
so	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
now	CODE
is	CODE
it's	CODE
presenting	CODE
itself	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
dict	CODE
but	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
functionality	CODE
and	CODE
because	CODE
i'm	CODE
overriding	CODE
the	CODE
_getitem_	CODE
and	CODE
_setitem_	CODE
functions	CODE
it's	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
accidently	CODE
recursively	CODE
call	CODE
_getitem_	CODE
so	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
if	CODE
extending	CODE
the	CODE
dict	CODE
class	CODE
will	CODE
cause	CODE
problems	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
slight	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
adding	CODE
data	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
dict	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
more	CODE
work	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
old	CODE
ddict	CODE
method	CODE
which	CODE
was	CODE
selfdata[seas_no][ep_no]['attribute']	CODE
=	CODE
'something'	CODE
see	CODE
_setitem	CODE
and	CODE
_setdata	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
bad	CODE
since	CODE
it's	CODE
currently	CODE
only	CODE
a	CODE
read-only	CODE
api	CODE
interface	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
users	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
should	CODE
only	CODE
ever	CODE
retrieve	CODE
data	CODE
not	CODE
add	CODE
more	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
hardly	CODE
elegant	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
series-of-classes	CODE
system	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
but	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
idea	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
and	CODE
would	CODE
extending	CODE
the	CODE
showcontaineretc	CODE
classes	CODE
with	CODE
dict	CODE
cause	CODE
problems	CODE
how	CODE
would	CODE
i	CODE
go	CODE
about	CODE
generating	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
all	CODE
possible	CODE
permutations	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
between	CODE
x	CODE
and	CODE
y	CODE
characters	CODE
in	CODE
length	CODE
containing	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
characters	CODE
any	CODE
language	CODE
would	CODE
work	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
portable	CODE
python	CODE
works	CODE
on	CODE
multiple	CODE
platforms	CODE
and	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
desktop	CODE
and	CODE
web	CODE
applications	CODE
thus	CODE
i	CODE
conclude	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
some	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
compile	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
executable	CODE
for	CODE
mac	CODE
windows	CODE
and	CODE
linux	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
being	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
idea	CODE
where	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
or	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
gui	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
anybody	CODE
shed	CODE
some	CODE
light	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
point	CODE
me	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
direction	CODE
please	CODE
i'm	CODE
writing	CODE
a	CODE
cms	CODE
application	CODE
in	CODE
php	CODE
and	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
requirements	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
interface	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
customer's	CODE
exchange	CODE
server	CODE
i've	CODE
written	CODE
up	CODE
this	CODE
functionality	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
times	CODE
before	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
always	CODE
used	CODE
webdav	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
now	CODE
i'm	CODE
leaning	CODE
away	CODE
from	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
running	CODE
the	CODE
site	CODE
on	CODE
iis	CODE
or	CODE
apache	CODE
no	CODE
preference	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
server	CODE
2008	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
things	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
include	CODE
adding	CODE
contacts	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
user's	CODE
address	CODE
book	CODE
sending	CODE
emails	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
user	CODE
and	CODE
running	CODE
reports	CODE
on	CODE
contacts	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
with	CODE
webdav	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
way	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
require	CODE
any	CODE
functionality	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
likely	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
deprecated	CODE
any	CODE
time	CODE
soon	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
update	CODE
justin	CODE
i	CODE
love	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
using	CODE
com	CODE
objects	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
worry	CODE
about	CODE
maintaining	CODE
a	CODE
3rd	CODE
product	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
everything	CODE
work	CODE
john	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
service	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
to	CODE
interface	CODE
with	CODE
for	CODE
these	CODE
functions	CODE
and	CODE
access	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
my	CODE
php	CODE
app	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
also	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
bit	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
100%	CODE
convinced	CODE
that	CODE
either	CODE
of	CODE
these	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
than	CODE
webdav	CODE
can	CODE
anyone	CODE
show	CODE
me	CODE
where	CODE
i'm	CODE
being	CODE
silly	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
jxta	CODE

so	CODE
for	CODE

lot	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
jxta	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
part	CODE
i	CODE
approached	CODE
jxta	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
just	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
work	CODE
attitude	CODE
i	CODE
used	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
jumpstart	CODE
creating	CODE
and	CODE
managing	CODE
my	CODE
peer-to-peer	CODE
overlay	CODE
network	CODE
and	CODE
providing	CODE
basic	CODE
communication	CODE
services	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
jxta	CODE
way	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
making	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
move	CODE
to	CODE
25	CODE
anyway	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
step	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
basic	CODE
creation	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
peergroup	CODE
i	CODE
see	CODE
some	CODE
new	CODE
new	CODE
mechanisms	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
meta-infservices	CODE
infrastructure	CODE
of	CODE
java	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
be	CODE
listing	CODE
a	CODE
related	CODE
peergroup	CODE
implementing	CODE
object	CODE
here	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
guid	CODE
in	CODE
netjxtaplatformmodule	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
when	CODE
a	CODE
group	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
spec	CODE
id	CODE
matching	CODE
the	CODE
guid	CODE
is	CODE
encountered	CODE
and	CODE
joined	CODE
or	CODE
created	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
automatically	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
matching	CODE
object	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
manually	CODE
tie	CODE
a	CODE
peergroup	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
group	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
new	CODE
method	CODE
using	CODE
meta-inf	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
manage	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
pointers	CODE
or	CODE
examples	CODE
of	CODE
using	CODE
this	CODE

for	CODE
peergroup	CODE
implementation	CODE
also	CODE
some	CODE
general	CODE
information	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
meta-infservices	CODE
mechanism	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
helpful	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
css	CODE

color	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE

actually	CODE
checking	CODE

try	CODE

a	CODE

such	CODE
as	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
code	CODE
recently	CODE
our	CODE
site	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
deluged	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE

the	CODE

by	CODE
encoding	CODE
the	CODE
t-sql	CODE
commands	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
ascii	CODE
encoded	CODE
binary	CODE
string	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
decode	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
sql	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
wary	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
didn't	CODE
know	CODE
exactly	CODE
what	CODE
was	CODE
happening	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
decode	CODE
tool	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
decode	CODE
this	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
text	CODE
without	CODE
even	CODE
touching	CODE
sqlserver	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
part	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
decoded	CODE
is	CODE
i've	CODE
tried	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
commands	CODE
with	CODE
no	CODE
luck	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
proper	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
translate	CODE
this	CODE
encoding	CODE
without	CODE
using	CODE
sql	CODE
server	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
possible	CODE
i'll	CODE
take	CODE
vbnet	CODE
code	CODE
since	CODE
i'm	CODE
familiar	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
too	CODE
okay	CODE
i'm	CODE
sure	CODE
i'm	CODE
missing	CODE
something	CODE
here	CODE
so	CODE
here's	CODE
where	CODE
i'm	CODE
at	CODE
since	CODE
my	CODE
input	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
basic	CODE
string	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
with	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
snippet	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
encoded	CODE
portion	CODE
-	CODE
4445434c41	CODE
which	CODE
translates	CODE
to	CODE
decla	CODE
-	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
attempt	CODE
was	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
all	CODE
it	CODE
did	CODE
was	CODE
return	CODE
the	CODE
exact	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
put	CODE
in	CODE
since	CODE
it	CODE
converted	CODE
each	CODE
character	CODE
into	CODE
is	CODE
byte	CODE
i	CODE
realized	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
each	CODE
two	CODE
characters	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
byte	CODE
manually	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
any	CODE
methods	CODE
yet	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
so	CODE
now	CODE
my	CODE
little	CODE
decoder	CODE
looks	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
things	CODE
look	CODE
good	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
pairs	CODE
but	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
balks	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
gets	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
4c	CODE
pair	CODE
and	CODE
says	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
incorrect	CODE
format	CODE
interestingly	CODE
enough	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
step	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
debugger	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
getstring	CODE
method	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
byte	CODE
array	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
-+	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
figure	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
missing	CODE
-	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
direct	CODE
cast	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
byte	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
it	CODE
using	CODE
aspnet	CODE
mvc	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
situations	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
form	CODE
submission	CODE
that	CODE
may	CODE
require	CODE
a	CODE
redirecttoaction	CODE
one	CODE
such	CODE
situation	CODE
is	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
encounter	CODE
validation	CODE
errors	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
submission	CODE
and	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
redirect	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
but	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
url	CODE
to	CODE
reflect	CODE
the	CODE
url	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
action	CODE
page	CODE
it	CODE
submits	CODE
to	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
require	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
to	CODE
contain	CODE
the	CODE
originally	CODE
posted	CODE
data	CODE
for	CODE
user	CODE
convenience	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
validation	CODE
purposes	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
pass	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
redirecttoaction	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
viewdata	CODE
parameter	CODE
my	CODE
post	CODE
parameters	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
changed	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
parameters	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
that	CODE
writes	CODE
information	CODE
to	CODE
file	CODE
this	CODE
information	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
post-execution	CODE
to	CODE
determine	CODE
passfailurecorrectness	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
written	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
these	CODE
passfailurecorrectness	CODE
checks	CODE
in	CODE
realtime	CODE
i	CODE
assume	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
what	CODE
are	CODE
the	CODE
gotchas	CODE
involved	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
java	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
reading	CODE
catches	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
writing	CODE
will	CODE
it	CODE
just	CODE
wait	CODE
for	CODE
more	CODE
writes	CODE
up	CODE
until	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
is	CODE
closed	CODE
or	CODE
will	CODE
the	CODE
read	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
at	CODE
this	CODE
point	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
latter	CODE
what	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
then	CODE
my	CODE
intuition	CODE
is	CODE
currently	CODE
pushing	CODE
me	CODE
towards	CODE
bufferedstreams	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
height	CODE
of	CODE
every	CODE
textbox	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
form	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
nested	CODE
within	CODE
other	CODE
controls	CODE
i	CODE
thought	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
spits	CODE
its	CODE
dummy	CODE
because	CODE
foreach	CODE
expects	CODE
an	CODE
ienumerable	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
an	CODE
ienumerator	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
without	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
separate	CODE
class	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
getenumerator	CODE
method	CODE
im	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
bookmarklet	CODE
for	CODE
posting	CODE
delicious	CODE
bookmarks	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
seperate	CODE
account	CODE
i	CODE
tested	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
line	CODE
like	CODE
and	CODE
this	CODE
works	CODE
great	CODE
i	CODE
then	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
bookmarklet	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
firefox	CODE
i	CODE
googled	CODE
and	CODE
found	CODE
bits	CODE
and	CODE
pieces	CODE
and	CODE
ended	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
but	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
happens	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
this	CODE
from	CODE
delicious	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
then	CODE
go	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
address	CODE
bar	CODE
and	CODE
press	CODE
enter	CODE
it	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
directly	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
bookmarks	CODE
so	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
line	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
constructor	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
call	CODE
to	CODE
super	CODE
be	CODE
it	CODE
implicitly	CODE
calling	CODE
super	CODE
or	CODE
explicitly	CODE
calling	CODE
another	CODE
constructor	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
is	CODE
why	CODE
can't	CODE
i	CODE
put	CODE
a	CODE
try	CODE
block	CODE
around	CODE
that	CODE
my	CODE
specific	CODE
case	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
mock	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
test	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
default	CODE
constructor	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
one	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
tests	CODE
simpler	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
wrap	CODE
the	CODE
exceptions	CODE
thrown	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
runtimeexception	CODE
so	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
effectively	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
java	CODE
complains	CODE
that	CODE
super	CODE
isn't	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
statement	CODE
my	CODE
workaround	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
workaround	CODE
why	CODE
doesn't	CODE
java	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
former	CODE
my	CODE
best	CODE
guess	CODE
as	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
why	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
java	CODE
doesn't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
constructed	CODE
object	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
potentially	CODE
inconsistent	CODE
state	CODE
however	CODE
in	CODE
doing	CODE
a	CODE
mock	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
care	CODE
about	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
is	CODE
safe	CODE
for	CODE
my	CODE
case	CODE
or	CODE
seems	CODE
as	CODE
though	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
anyways	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
overriding	CODE
any	CODE
methods	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
tested	CODE
class	CODE
so	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
risk	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
uninitialized	CODE
variables	CODE
in	CODE
many	CODE
places123	CODE
and	CODE
[123]	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
interchangably	CODE
when	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
one	CODE
or	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
and	CODE
why	CODE
suppose	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
css	CODE
rule	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
page	CODE
body	CODE
{	CODE
font-family	CODE
calibri	CODE
trebuchet	CODE
ms	CODE
helvetica	CODE
sans-serif	CODE
}	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
detect	CODE
which	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
defined	CODE
fonts	CODE
was	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
user's	CODE
browser	CODE
edit	CODE
for	CODE
people	CODE
wondering	CODE
why	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
font	CODE
i'm	CODE
detecting	CODE
contains	CODE
glyph's	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
available	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
fonts	CODE
and	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
font	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
a	CODE
link	CODE
asking	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
to	CODE
download	CODE
that	CODE
font	CODE
so	CODE
they	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
my	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
font	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
displaying	CODE
the	CODE
download	CODE
font	CODE
link	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
users	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
only	CODE
display	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
people	CODE
who	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
font	CODE
installed	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
currently	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
and	CODE
my	CODE
goal	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
locate	CODE
text	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
ocr'ing	CODE
the	CODE
text	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
my	CODE
intention	CODE
as	CODE
of	CODE
yet	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
basically	CODE
obtain	CODE
the	CODE
bounds	CODE
of	CODE
text	CODE
within	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
aforgenet	CODE
imaging	CODE
component	CODE
for	CODE
manipulation	CODE
any	CODE
assistance	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
sense	CODE
or	CODE
another	CODE
update	CODE
2509	CODE
i've	CODE
since	CODE
went	CODE
along	CODE
another	CODE
route	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
project	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
attempt	CODE
to	CODE
obtain	CODE
text	CODE
using	CODE
modi	CODE
microsoft	CODE
office	CODE
document	CODE
imaging	CODE
it	CODE
allows	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
ocr	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
and	CODE
pull	CODE
text	CODE
from	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
ease	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
exe	CODE
file	CODE
has	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
string	CODE
which	CODE
invoked	CODE
it	CODE
including	CODE
its	CODE
path	CODE
and	CODE
filename	CODE
eg	CODE
c\myapp\myappexe	CODE
--help	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
so	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
dll	CODE
invoked	CODE
via	CODE
loadlibrary	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
dll	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
its	CODE
path	CODE
and	CODE
filename	CODE
is	CODE
specifically	CODE
i'm	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
delphi	CODE
solution	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
suspect	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
pretty	CODE
much	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
language	CODE
when	CODE
asked	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
system	CODE
xyz	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
ask	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
over	CODE
php	CODE
or	CODE
ruby	CODE
what	CODE
are	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
features	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
mention	CODE
when	CODE
they	CODE
require	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
explain	CODE
it	CODE
by	CODE
generate	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
auto-generation	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
necessary	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
particuliar	CODE
selected	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
variables	CODE
but	CODE
any	CODE
more	CODE
explicit	CODE
explication	CODE
or	CODE
comment	CODE
on	CODE
good	CODE
practice	CODE
is	CODE
welcome	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
client-server	CODE
app	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
is	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
mobile	CODE
6	CODE
device	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
is	CODE
on	CODE
full	CODE
windows	CODE
and	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
originally	CODE
i	CODE
only	CODE
needed	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
send	CODE
messages	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
only	CODE
ever	CODE
sending	CODE
back	CODE
an	CODE
acknowledgment	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
received	CODE
the	CODE
message	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
update	CODE
it	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
can	CODE
actually	CODE
send	CODE
a	CODE
message	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
to	CODE
request	CODE
data	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
currently	CODE
have	CODE
it	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
is	CODE
only	CODE
in	CODE
receive	CODE
mode	CODE
after	CODE
it	CODE
sends	CODE
data	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
this	CODE
doesn't	CODE
allow	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
to	CODE
send	CODE
a	CODE
request	CODE
at	CODE
any	CODE
time	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
wait	CODE
for	CODE
client	CODE
data	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
thought	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
another	CODE
thread	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
separate	CODE
open	CODE
socket	CODE
listening	CODE
for	CODE
server	CODE
requestsjust	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
already	CODE
has	CODE
in	CODE
respect	CODE
the	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thread	CODE
and	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
socket	CODE
to	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
to	CODE
send	CODE
requests	CODE
at	CODE
any	CODE
time	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
something	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
affect	CODE
of	CODE
waitformultipleobjects	CODE
and	CODE
pass	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
receive	CODE
buffer	CODE
and	CODE
an	CODE
event	CODE
that	CODE
tells	CODE
it	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
data	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
sent	CODE
i've	CODE
never	CODE
been	CODE
completely	CODE
happy	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
exception	CODE
handling	CODE
works	CODE
there's	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
exceptions	CODE
and	CODE
trycatch	CODE
brings	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
table	CODE
stack	CODE
unwinding	CODE
etc	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
break	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
oo	CODE
model	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
anyway	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
class	CODE
which	CODE
wraps	CODE
or	CODE
includes	CODE
networked	CODE
file	CODE
io	CODE
operations	CODE
eg	CODE
reading	CODE
and	CODE
writing	CODE
to	CODE
some	CODE
file	CODE
at	CODE
some	CODE
particular	CODE
unc	CODE
path	CODE
somewhere	CODE
for	CODE
various	CODE
reasons	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
those	CODE
io	CODE
operations	CODE
to	CODE
fail	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
detect	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
fail	CODE
you	CODE
retry	CODE
them	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
keep	CODE
retrying	CODE
them	CODE
until	CODE
they	CODE
succeed	CODE
or	CODE
you	CODE
reach	CODE
a	CODE
timeout	CODE
i	CODE
already	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
convenient	CODE
retrytimer	CODE
class	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
instantiate	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
sleep	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
thread	CODE
between	CODE
retries	CODE
and	CODE
determine	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
timeout	CODE
period	CODE
has	CODE
elapsed	CODE
etc	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
io	CODE
operations	CODE
in	CODE
several	CODE
methods	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
class	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
wrap	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
in	CODE
try-catch	CODE
retry	CODE
logic	CODE
here's	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
code	CODE
snippet	CODE
so	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
avoid	CODE
duplicating	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
every	CODE
file	CODE
io	CODE
operation	CODE
throughout	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
my	CODE
solution	CODE
was	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
anonymous	CODE
delegate	CODE
blocks	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
method	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
which	CODE
executed	CODE
the	CODE
delegate	CODE
block	CODE
passed	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
allowed	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
methods	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
somewhat	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
leaves	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
desired	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
hear	CODE
how	CODE
other	CODE
people	CODE
would	CODE
solve	CODE
this	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
problem	CODE
i'm	CODE
having	CODE
trouble	CODE
figuring	CODE
out	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
testing	CODE
framework	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
and	CODE
usable	CODE
in	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2008	CODE
for	CODE
c++	CODE
presumably	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
built-in	CODE
unit	CODE
testing	CODE
suite	CODE
any	CODE
links	CODE
or	CODE
tutorials	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
appreciated	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
msve	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
tiles	CODE
i'm	CODE
displaying	CODE
in	CODE
layers	CODE
on	CODE
top	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
there's	CODE
a	CODE
ton	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
and	CODE
they're	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
network	CODE
server	CODE
in	CODE
certain	CODE
directories	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
something	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
30000+	CODE
files	CODE
initially	CODE
i	CODE
called	CODE
directorygetfiles	CODE
but	CODE
once	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
testing	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
pseudo-real	CODE
environment	CODE
it	CODE
timed	CODE
out	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
programatically	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
iterate	CODE
through	CODE
this	CODE
many	CODE
files	CODE
edit	CODE
my	CODE
coworker	CODE
suggested	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
ms	CODE
indexing	CODE
service	CODE
has	CODE
anyone	CODE
tried	CODE
this	CODE
approach	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
has	CODE
it	CODE
worked	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
two	CODE
popular	CODE
closure	CODE
styles	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
i	CODE
call	CODE
anonymous	CODE
constructor	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
inline	CODE
executed	CODE
function	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
differences	CODE
in	CODE
behaviour	CODE
between	CODE
those	CODE
two	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
better	CODE
over	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
i	CODE
recently	CODE
encountered	CODE
a	CODE
problem	CODE
where	CODE
a	CODE
value	CODE
was	CODE
null	CODE
if	CODE
accessed	CODE
with	CODE
requestform	CODE
but	CODE
fine	CODE
if	CODE
retrieved	CODE
with	CODE
requestparams	CODE
what	CODE
are	CODE
the	CODE
differences	CODE
between	CODE
these	CODE
methods	CODE
that	CODE
could	CODE
cause	CODE
this	CODE
why	CODE
is	CODE
arraylength	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
uint	CODE
this	CODE
bothers	CODE
me	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
because	CODE
a	CODE
length	CODE
value	CODE
can	CODE
never	CODE
by	CODE
negative	CODE
this	CODE
also	CODE
forced	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
length-property	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
class	CODE
because	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
specify	CODE
an	CODE
int-value	CODE
this	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
cast	CODE
explicitly	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
ultimate	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
use	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
unsigned	CODE
int	CODE
uint	CODE
even	CODE
microsoft	CODE
seems	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
them	CODE
i'm	CODE
about	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
a	CODE
piece	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
construct	CODE
and	CODE
post	CODE
an	CODE
xml	CODE
document	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
service	CODE
and	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
means	CODE
to	CODE
expand	CODE
my	CODE
skills	CODE
in	CODE
it	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
whilst	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
model	CODE
fairly	CODE
well	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
i'm	CODE
uncertain	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
pros	CODE
and	CODE
cons	CODE
are	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
models	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
anyone	CODE
have	CODE
experience	CODE
doing	CODE
xml	CODE
processing	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
where	CODE
would	CODE
you	CODE
suggest	CODE
i	CODE
start	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
files	CODE
i'll	CODE
be	CODE
building	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
fairly	CODE
simple	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
classes	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
video	CODE
playback	CODE
and	CODE
recording	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
main	CODE
class	CODE
which	CODE
acts	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
public	CODE
interface	CODE
with	CODE
methods	CODE
like	CODE
play	CODE
stop	CODE
pause	CODE
record	CODE
etc	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
workhorse	CODE
classes	CODE
which	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
video	CODE
decoding	CODE
and	CODE
video	CODE
encoding	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
learned	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
existence	CODE
of	CODE
nested	CODE
classes	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
and	CODE
i'm	CODE
curious	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
what	CODE
programmers	CODE
think	CODE
about	CODE
using	CODE
them	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
wary	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
sure	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
benefitsdrawbacks	CODE
are	CODE
but	CODE
they	CODE
seem	CODE
according	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
book	CODE
i'm	CODE
reading	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
cases	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
mine	CODE
the	CODE
book	CODE
suggests	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
scenario	CODE
like	CODE
mine	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
solution	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
nest	CODE
the	CODE
workhorse	CODE
classes	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
interface	CODE
class	CODE
so	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
no	CODE
separate	CODE
files	CODE
for	CODE
classes	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
meant	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
avoid	CODE
any	CODE
possible	CODE
naming	CODE
conflicts	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
about	CODE
these	CODE
justifications	CODE
nested	CODE
classes	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
concept	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
just	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
what	CODE
programmers	CODE
think	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
issue	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
an	CODE
element	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
loaded	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
contentplaceholder	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
listview	CODE
that	CODE
lists	CODE
people's	CODE
names	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
navigation	CODE
area	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
update	CODE
the	CODE
listview	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
person	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
added	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
table	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
listview	CODE
is	CODE
data	CODE
bound	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
listview	CODE
currently	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
update	CODE
it's	CODE
values	CODE
until	CODE
the	CODE
cache	CODE
is	CODE
reloaded	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
found	CODE
that	CODE
just	CODE
re-running	CODE
the	CODE
listviewdatabind	CODE
will	CODE
update	CODE
a	CODE
listview's	CODE
contents	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
not	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
listviewdatabind	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
page	CODE
that	CODE
uses	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
below	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
sample	CODE
of	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
but	CODE
a	CODE
compiler	CODE
error	CODE
says	CODE
peoplelistview	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
exist	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
context	CODE
gismaster	CODE
-	CODE
where	CODE
listview	CODE
resides	CODE
gisinput_peopleaspx	CODE
-	CODE
uses	CODE
gismaster	CODE
as	CODE
it's	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
gisinput_peopleaspxcs	CODE
what	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
resolve	CODE
an	CODE
issue	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
net	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
sites	CODE
i	CODE
maintain	CODE
relies	CODE
heavily	CODE
on	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
viewstate	CODE
it	CODE
isn't	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
however	CODE
on	CODE
certain	CODE
pages	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
is	CODE
extra-bloated	CODE
safari	CODE
throws	CODE
a	CODE
validation	CODE
of	CODE
viewstate	CODE
mac	CODE
failed	CODE
error	CODE
this	CODE
appears	CODE
to	CODE
only	CODE
happen	CODE
in	CODE
safari	CODE
firefox	CODE
ie	CODE
and	CODE
opera	CODE
all	CODE
load	CODE
successfully	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
scenario	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
delimit	CODE
a	CODE
javascript	CODE
databound	CODE
string	CODE
parameter	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
anchor	CODE
onclick	CODE
event	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
anchor	CODE
tag	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
aspnet	CODE
repeater	CODE
control	CODE
the	CODE
onclick	CODE
event	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
anchor	CODE
contains	CODE
a	CODE
call	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
takes	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
for	CODE
its	CODE
input	CODE
parameter	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
parameter	CODE
is	CODE
populated	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
databound	CODE
value	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
repeater	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
the	CODE
double	CODE
quotes	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
containerdataitem	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
the	CODE
'single	CODE
quotes'	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
onclick	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
still	CODE
need	CODE
one	CODE
more	CODE
delimiter	CODE
triple	CODE
quotes	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
string	CODE
parameter	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
call	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
use	CODE
'single	CODE
quotes'	CODE
again	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
ensure	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
knows	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
parameter	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
extra	CODE
quotes	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
string	CODE
parameter	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
thinks	CODE
i'm	CODE
passing	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
cheers	CODE
in	CODE
advance	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
knowledge	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
drop	CODE
the	CODE
anchor	CODE
and	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
typical	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
string	CODE
pseudocode	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
container	CODE
object	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
stringbuilder	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
loop	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
strings	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
appending	CODE
a	CODE
comma	CODE
after	CODE
each	CODE
one	CODE
after	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
remove	CODE
that	CODE
last	CODE
superfluous	CODE
comma	CODE
code	CODE
sample	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
adding	CODE
the	CODE
comma	CODE
by	CODE
checking	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
container	CODE
is	CODE
empty	CODE
but	CODE
doesn't	CODE
that	CODE
mean	CODE
more	CODE
processing	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
the	CODE
length	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
on	CODE
each	CODE
occurrence	CODE
i	CODE
feel	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
an	CODE
easiercleanermore	CODE
efficient	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
removing	CODE
that	CODE
last	CODE
comma	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
experience	CODE
writing	CODE
console	CODE
and	CODE
network	CODE
clientserver	CODE
applications	CODE
in	CODE
c	CODE
and	CODE
c++	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
next	CODE
to	CODE
nothing	CODE
about	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
visual	CODE
api	CODE
mfc	CODE
qt	CODE
wxwidgets	CODE
etc	CODE
where	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
place	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
and	CODE
what	CODE
method	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
specialize	CODE
in	CODE
so	CODE
as	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
future	CODE
ready	CODE
and	CODE
robust	CODE
a	CODE
researcher	CODE
has	CODE
created	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
simulation	CODE
in	CODE
matlab	CODE
and	CODE
we	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
accessible	CODE
to	CODE
others	CODE
my	CODE
plan	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
take	CODE
the	CODE
simulation	CODE
clean	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
things	CODE
and	CODE
turn	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
functions	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
plan	CODE
to	CODE
compile	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
c	CODE
library	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
swig	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
python	CODE
wrapper	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
simulation	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
django	CODE
app	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
i	CODE
hope	CODE
so	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
plan	CODE
has	CODE
anyone	CODE
else	CODE
done	CODE
something	CODE
similar	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
some	CODE
serious	CODE

to	CODE
print	CODE

sizemode	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
zoom	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
contained	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
picturebox	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
displayed	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
aspect-correct	CODE
way	CODE
regardless	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
dimensions	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
picturebox	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
great	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
visual	CODE
appearance	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
size	CODE
the	CODE
window	CODE
however	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
will	CODE
always	CODE
be	CODE
displayed	CODE
using	CODE
its	CODE
best	CODE
fit	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
mouse	CODE
click	CODE
events	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
picture	CODE
box	CODE
and	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
translate	CODE
from	CODE
screen-space	CODE
coordinates	CODE
to	CODE
image-space	CODE
coordinates	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
it's	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
translate	CODE
from	CODE
screen	CODE
space	CODE
to	CODE
control	CODE
space	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
see	CODE
any	CODE
obvious	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
translate	CODE
from	CODE
control	CODE
space	CODE
to	CODE
image	CODE
space	CODE
ie	CODE
the	CODE
pixel	CODE
coordinate	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
image	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
scaled	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
picture	CODE
box	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
an	CODE
easy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
or	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
duplicate	CODE
the	CODE
scaling	CODE
math	CODE
that	CODE
they're	CODE
using	CODE
internally	CODE
to	CODE
position	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
and	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
translation	CODE
myself	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
to	CODE
introduce	CODE
a	CODE
unit	CODE
testing	CODE
framework	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
mix	CODE
at	CODE
my	CODE
job	CODE
we're	CODE
using	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2005	CODE
though	CODE
we	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
moving	CODE
to	CODE
2008	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
6	CODE
months	CODE
and	CODE
work	CODE
primarily	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
framework	CODE
has	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
ide	CODE
integration	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
best	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
open	CODE
to	CODE
frameworks	CODE
that	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
integration	CODE
but	CODE
are	CODE
still	CODE
relatively	CODE
simple	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
i'm	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
resistance	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
one	CODE
way	CODE
or	CODE
another	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
pushing	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
pain	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
neck	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
help	CODE
my	CODE
case	CODE
the	CODE
obvious	CODE
choice	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
research	CODE
i've	CODE
done	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
points	CODE
to	CODE
nunit	CODE
but	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
impressions	CODE
of	CODE
someone	CODE
who's	CODE
actually	CODE
used	CODE
it	CODE
before	CODE
recommending	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
team	CODE
has	CODE
anyone	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
used	CODE
nunit	CODE
if	CODE
so	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
pitfalls	CODE
or	CODE
limitations	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
other	CODE
good	CODE
options	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
if	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you've	CODE
used	CODE
both	CODE
nunit	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
i'd	CODE
greatly	CODE
appreciate	CODE
an	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
strengths	CODE
and	CODE
weaknesses	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
writing	CODE
my	CODE
aspnet	CODE
c#	CODE
applications	CODE
in	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
i	CODE
used	CODE
my	CODE
favorite	CODE
text	CODE
editor	CODE
ultraedit32	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
anyway	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
implement	CODE
mvc	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
vs	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
just	CODE
wondering	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
elegant	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
maximum	CODE
cpu	CODE
load	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
thread	CODE
doing	CODE
intensive	CODE
calculations	CODE
right	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
located	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
time	CODE
consuming	CODE
loop	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
only	CODE
compression	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
gettickcount	CODE
and	CODE
sleep	CODE
with	CODE
hardcoded	CODE
values	CODE
it	CODE
makes	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
continues	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
period	CODE
of	CODE
time	CODE
and	CODE
than	CODE
sleeps	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
minimal	CODE
time	CODE
it	CODE
more	CODE
or	CODE
less	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
job	CODE
ie	CODE
guarantees	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
50%	CODE
of	CODE
cpu	CODE
however	CODE
behavior	CODE
is	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
cpu	CODE
cores	CODE
huge	CODE
disadvantage	CODE
and	CODE
simply	CODE
ugly	CODE
smaller	CODE
disadvantage	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
i've	CODE
read	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
object	CODE
eg	CODE
not	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
definition	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
monkey	CODE
patching	CODE
or	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
cases	CODE
duck	CODE
punching	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
that	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
always	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
decision	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
so	CODE
but	CODE
how	CODE
might	CODE
one	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
update	CODE
8042008	CODE
002101	CODE
est	CODE
that	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
answer	CODE
john	CODE
downey	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
ends	CODE
up	CODE
being	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
true	CODE
method	CODE
your	CODE
example	CODE
defines	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
patch	CODE
function	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
argument	CODE
of	CODE
self	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
write	CODE
actual	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
the	CODE
now	CODE
patched	CODE
class	CODE
method	CODE
asks	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
argument	CODE
named	CODE
self	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
automagically	CODE
recognize	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
which	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
bind	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
would	CODE
happen	CODE
if	CODE
defined	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
definition	CODE
meaning	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
classpatchobj	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
just	CODE
classpatch	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
functionality	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
true	CODE
method	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
python	CODE
isn't	CODE
really	CODE
treating	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
but	CODE
more	CODE
just	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
which	CODE
happens	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
and	CODE
as	CODE
such	CODE
is	CODE
callable	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
attach	CODE
an	CODE
actual	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
oh	CODE
and	CODE
ryan	CODE
that	CODE
isn't	CODE
exactly	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
builtin	CODE
functionality	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
quite	CODE
cool	CODE
nonetheless	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
an	CODE
efficient	CODE
method	CODE
of	CODE
converting	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
written	CODE
numbers	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
would	CODE
return	CODE
twenty	CODE
one	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
involve	CODE
a	CODE
massive	CODE
look-up	CODE
table	CODE
i	CODE
specifically	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
style	CODE
of	CODE
background-color	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
body	CODE
tag	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
behind	CODE
c#	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
content	CODE
page	CODE
that	CODE
uses	CODE
that	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
different	CODE
content	CODE
pages	CODE
that	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
has	CODE
different	CODE
colors	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
which	CODE
content	CODE
page	CODE
is	CODE
loaded	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
matches	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
page's	CODE
theme	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
below	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
more	CODE
like	CODE
inside	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
load	CODE
function	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
page	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
line	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
i	CODE
only	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
background-color	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
body	CODE
tag	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
c	CODE
library	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
the	CODE
index	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
character	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
all	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
are	CODE
functions	CODE
like	CODE
strstr	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
the	CODE
found	CODE
char	CODE
*	CODE
not	CODE
it's	CODE
location	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
string	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
just	CODE
looking	CODE
through	CODE
some	CODE
information	CODE
about	CODE
google's	CODE
protocol	CODE
buffers	CODE
data	CODE
interchange	CODE
format	CODE
has	CODE
anyone	CODE
played	CODE
around	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
or	CODE
even	CODE
created	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
around	CODE
it	CODE
i'm	CODE
currently	CODE
using	CODE
xml	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
python	CODE
project	CODE
for	CODE
structured	CODE
content	CODE
created	CODE
by	CODE
hand	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
text	CODE
editor	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
wondering	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
general	CODE
opinion	CODE
was	CODE
on	CODE
protocol	CODE
buffers	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
user-facing	CODE
input	CODE
format	CODE
the	CODE
speed	CODE
and	CODE
brevity	CODE
benefits	CODE
definitely	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
there	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
so	CODE
many	CODE
factors	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
comes	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
generating	CODE
and	CODE
processing	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
tab	CODE
key	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
a	CODE
text	CODE
box	CODE
to	CODE
tab	CODE
over	CODE
four	CODE
spaces	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
now	CODE
the	CODE
tab	CODE
key	CODE
jumps	CODE
my	CODE
cursor	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
input	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
some	CODE
javascript	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
capture	CODE
the	CODE
tab	CODE
key	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
text	CODE
box	CODE
before	CODE
it	CODE
bubbles	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
ui	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
some	CODE
browsers	CODE
ie	CODE
firefox	CODE
may	CODE
not	CODE
allow	CODE
this	CODE
how	CODE
about	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
key-combo	CODE
like	CODE
shift+tab	CODE
or	CODE
ctrl+q	CODE
using	CODE
mapi	CODE
functions	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
officially	CODE
unsupported	CODE
apparently	CODE
mapi	CODE
uses	CODE
its	CODE
own	CODE
memory	CODE
management	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
crashes	CODE
and	CODE
burns	CODE
within	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
see	CODE
here	CODE
and	CODE
here	CODE
all	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
launch	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
e-mail	CODE
client	CODE
with	CODE
subject	CODE
body	CODE
and	CODE
one	CODE
or	CODE
more	CODE
attachments	CODE
so	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
looking	CODE
into	CODE
mapisenddocuments	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
gather	CODE
courage	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
in	CODE
production	CODE
code	CODE
has	CODE
anybody	CODE
used	CODE
this	CODE
function	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE

i'm	CODE
just	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE

he	CODE
actually	CODE
wants	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
i've	CODE
noticed	CODE
that	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
our	CODE
sessions	CODE
have	CODE
gotten	CODE
bogged	CODE
down	CODE
in	CODE
minor	CODE
details	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
feel	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
very	CODE
organized	CODE

have	CODE
helped	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
what	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
better	CODE
to	CODE

him	CODE
effectively	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE

i	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
through	CODE
concept	CODE
by	CODE
concept	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
complexities	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
avoid	CODE
till	CODE
later	CODE
the	CODE

we	CODE
are	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
is	CODE

when	CODE
a	CODE

finds	CODE
a	CODE

i	CODE
can	CODE
log	CODE
the	CODE

they	CODE

tell	CODE

to	CODE
upgrade	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE

a	CODE
short	CODE
explanation	CODE
of	CODE
how	CODE
the	CODE

works	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
be	CODE
appreciated	CODE
when	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
build	CODE

revision	CODE

get	CODE
incremented	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
cross-platform	CODE
python	CODE
application	CODE
which	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
a	CODE
jpeg	CODE
preview	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE

of	CODE
a	CODE
pdf	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
am	CODE
spawning	CODE
sips	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
something	CODE
similarly	CODE
simple	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
flash	CODE
content	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
winforms	CODE
application	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
control	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
picturebox	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
images	CODE
and	CODE
flash	CODE
content	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
great	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
flash	CODE
content	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
stream	CODE
of	CODE
sorts	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
on	CODE
disk	CODE
i'm	CODE
just	CODE
getting	CODE
into	CODE
creating	CODE
some	CODE
wcf	CODE
services	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
requirement	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
them	CODE
backward	CODE
compatible	CODE
for	CODE
legacy	CODE
net	CODE
11	CODE
and	CODE
20	CODE
client	CODE
applications	CODE
i've	CODE
managed	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
services	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
correctly	CODE
for	CODE
30	CODE
and	CODE
greater	CODE
clients	CODE
but	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
publish	CODE
the	CODE
services	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
basichttpbinding	CODE
endpoint	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
is	CODE
required	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
compatibility	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
the	CODE
service	CODE
refactors	CODE
my	CODE
method	CODE
signatures	CODE
eg	CODE
appears	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
apps	CODE
as	CODE
i've	CODE
tried	CODE
every	CODE
configuration	CODE
parameter	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
appconfig	CODE
for	CODE
my	CODE
self-hosting	CODE
console	CODE
app	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
this	CODE
function	CODE
as	CODE
expected	CODE
i	CODE
suppose	CODE
this	CODE
might	CODE
lead	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
fact	CODE
that	CODE
my	CODE
expectations	CODE
are	CODE
flawed	CODE
but	CODE
i'd	CODE
be	CODE
surprised	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
wcf	CODE
service	CODE
is	CODE
incapable	CODE
of	CODE
handling	CODE
a	CODE
bool	CODE
return	CODE
type	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
down-level	CODE
client	CODE
my	CODE
current	CODE
appconfig	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
can	CODE
anyone	CODE
advise	CODE
please	CODE
one	CODE
may	CODE
not	CODE
always	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
at	CODE
compile-time	CODE
but	CODE
may	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
an	CODE
instance	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
object	CODE
instance	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
type	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
photoshop's	CODE
javascript	CODE
api	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
fonts	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
psd	CODE
given	CODE
a	CODE
font	CODE
name	CODE
returned	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
physical	CODE
font	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
that	CODE
font	CODE
name	CODE
corresponds	CODE
to	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
disc	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
all	CODE
happening	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
python	CODE
program	CODE
running	CODE
on	CODE
osx	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
guess	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
some	CODE
photoshop	CODE
javascript	CODE
a	CODE
python	CODE
function	CODE
an	CODE
osx	CODE
api	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
call	CODE
from	CODE
python	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
this	CODE
fails	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
error	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
that	CODE
primitives	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
reference	CODE
types	CODE
ie	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
and	CODE
so	CODE
cannot	CODE
have	CODE
methods	CODE
however	CODE
java	CODE
5	CODE
introduced	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
and	CODE
unboxing	CODE
a	CODE
la	CODE
c#	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
never	CODE
liked	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
beside	CODE
the	CODE
point	CODE
so	CODE
with	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
expect	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
myint	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
tostring	CODE
on	CODE
that	CODE
furthermore	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
c#	CODE
allows	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
call	CODE
unless	CODE
i	CODE
remember	CODE
incorrectly	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
just	CODE
an	CODE
unfortunate	CODE
shortcoming	CODE
of	CODE
java's	CODE
autoboxingunboxing	CODE
specification	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
reason	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
uploading	CODE
my	CODE

sized	CODE
web	CODE
app	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
shared	CODE
host	CODE
provided	CODE
me	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
fresh	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
challenges	CODE
by	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
sleepless	CODE
nights	CODE
the	CODE
issue	CODE
was	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
most	CODE
certainly	CODE
not	CODE
developed	CODE
my	CODE
application	CODE
for	CODE
medium	CODE
trust	CODE
or	CODE
had	CODE
any	CODE
clue	CODE
what	CODE
that	CODE
was	CODE
i	CODE
mitigated	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
issues	CODE
save	CODE
one	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
written	CODE
an	CODE
installer	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
admin	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
specify	CODE
their	CODE
connectionstring	CODE
and	CODE
other	CODE

but	CODE
i	CODE
cannot	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
webconfig	CODE
in	CODE
medium	CODE
trust	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
or	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
be	CODE
putting	CODE
preferences	CODE
in	CODE
another	CODE
file	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
just	CODE
sitting	CODE
at	CODE
my	CODE
local	CODE
borders	CODE
sipping	CODE
coffee	CODE
and	CODE
reading	CODE
more	CODE
joel	CODE
on	CODE
software	CODE
for	CODE
free	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
came	CODE
across	CODE
joel	CODE
spolsky	CODE
saying	CODE
something	CODE
about	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
programmer	CODE
knowing	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
and	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
in	CODE
javac#	CODE
object	CODE
oriented	CODE
programming	CODE
languages	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
'brain	CODE
check'	CODE
i	CODE
realized	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
dismay	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
didn't	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
aware	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
three	CODE
timer	CODE
types	CODE
see	CODE
comparing	CODE
the	CODE
timer	CODE
classes	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
framework	CODE
class	CODE
library	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
chosen	CODE
a	CODE
threaded	CODE
timer	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
types	CODE
can	CODE
drift	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
thread	CODE
is	CODE
busy	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
this	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
reliable	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
this	CODE
timer	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
timer	CODE
is	CODE
put	CODE
on	CODE
another	CODE
thread	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
always	CODE
tick	CODE
along	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
work	CODE
begin	CODE
completed	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
parent	CODE
thread	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
busy	CODE
the	CODE
issue	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
timer	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
console	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
while	CODE
the	CODE
timer	CODE
is	CODE
ticking	CODE
along	CODE
on	CODE
another	CODE
thread	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
thread	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
doing	CODE
anything	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
closes	CODE
i	CODE
tried	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
while	CODE
true	CODE
loop	CODE
but	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
thread	CODE
is	CODE
too	CODE
busy	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
timer	CODE
does	CODE
go	CODE
off	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
recent	CODE
java	CODE
project	CODE
we	CODE
needed	CODE
a	CODE
free	CODE
java	CODE
based	CODE
real-time	CODE
data	CODE
plotting	CODE
utility	CODE
after	CODE
much	CODE
searching	CODE
we	CODE
found	CODE
this	CODE
tool	CODE
called	CODE
the	CODE
scientific	CODE
graphics	CODE
toolkit	CODE
or	CODE
sgt	CODE
from	CODE
noaa	CODE
it	CODE
seemed	CODE
pretty	CODE
robust	CODE
but	CODE
we	CODE
found	CODE
out	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
wasn't	CODE
terribly	CODE
configurable	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
not	CODE
configurable	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
meet	CODE
our	CODE
needs	CODE
we	CODE
ended	CODE
up	CODE
digging	CODE
very	CODE
deeply	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
reverse	CODE
engineering	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
changing	CODE
it	CODE
all	CODE
around	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
plot	CODE
tool	CODE
look	CODE
and	CODE
act	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
we	CODE
wanted	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
and	CODE
act	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
this	CODE
killed	CODE
any	CODE
chance	CODE
for	CODE
future	CODE
upgrades	CODE
from	CODE
noaa	CODE
so	CODE
what	CODE
free	CODE
or	CODE
cheap	CODE
java	CODE
based	CODE
data	CODE
plotting	CODE
tools	CODE
or	CODE
libraries	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
followup	CODE
thanks	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
jfreechart	CODE
suggestions	CODE
i	CODE
checked	CODE
out	CODE
their	CODE
website	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
very	CODE
nice	CODE
data	CODE
charting	CODE
and	CODE
plotting	CODE
utility	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
made	CODE
it	CODE
clear	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
original	CODE
question	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
looking	CODE
specifically	CODE
to	CODE
plot	CODE
real-time	CODE
data	CODE
i	CODE
corrected	CODE
my	CODE
question	CODE
above	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
clear	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
jfreechart	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE
live	CODE
data	CODE
is	CODE
marginal	CODE
at	CODE
best	CODE
though	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
suggestions	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
the	CODE
aspnet	CODE
ajax	CODE
modalpopupextender	CODE
has	CODE
oncancelscript	CODE
and	CODE
onokscript	CODE
properties	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
onshowscript	CODE
property	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
specify	CODE
a	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
each	CODE
time	CODE
the	CODE
popup	CODE
is	CODE
shown	CODE
in	CODE
past	CODE
situations	CODE
i	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
targetcontrolid	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
dummy	CODE
control	CODE
and	CODE
provide	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
control	CODE
that	CODE
first	CODE
does	CODE
some	CODE
js	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
uses	CODE
the	CODE
js	CODE
methods	CODE
to	CODE
show	CODE
the	CODE
popup	CODE
but	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
showing	CODE
the	CODE
popup	CODE
from	CODE
both	CODE
client	CODE
and	CODE
server	CODE
side	CODE
code	CODE
anyone	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
btw	CODE
i	CODE
needed	CODE
this	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
textbox	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
modal	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
tinymce	CODE
editor	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
tinymce	CODE
init	CODE
script	CODE
doesn't	CODE
work	CODE
on	CODE
invisible	CODE
textboxes	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
it	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
the	CODE
modal	CODE
was	CODE
shown	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
tasked	CODE
by	CODE
my	CODE
wife	CODE
with	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
program	CODE
to	CODE
allow	CODE
her	CODE
to	CODE
track	CODE
the	CODE
family	CODE
trees	CODE
on	CODE
both	CODE
sides	CODE
of	CODE
our	CODE
family	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
cost	CODE
effective	CODE
free	CODE
control	CODE
to	CODE
represent	CODE
this	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
information	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
modified	CODE
org-chart	CODE
type	CODE
charttree	CODE
the	CODE
modification	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
any	CODE
node	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
2	CODE
parent	CODE
nodes	CODE
eg	CODE
a	CODE
child	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
motherfather	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
i've	CODE
came	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
2	CODE
trees	CODE
an	CODE
ancestor	CODE
tree	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
descendants	CODE
tree	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
individual	CODE
being	CODE
inspected	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
root	CODE
node	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
tree	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
clunky	CODE
i'm	CODE
working	CODE
primarily	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
winforms	CODE
so	CODE
net	CODE
type	CODE
controls	CODE
or	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
preferrable	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
create	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
custom	CODE
moniker	CODE
or	CODE
url	CODE
protocol	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
systems	CODE
examples	CODE
http	CODE
mailto	CODE
service	CODE
i'm	CODE
writing	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
basically	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
preferences	CODE
dialog	CODE
much	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
tree-view	CODE
preferences	CODE
dialog	CODE
that	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
itself	CODE
uses	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
simply	CODE
a	CODE
pass-through	CODE
for	CODE
data	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
serial	CODE
device	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
it	CODE
performs	CODE
many	CODE
many	CODE
transformations	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
before	CODE
writing	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
gui	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
simply	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
that	CODE
dictate	CODE
what	CODE
those	CODE
transformations	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
about	CODE
designingcoding	CODE
a	CODE
tree-view	CODE
preferences	CODE
dialog	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
going	CODE
about	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
building	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
window	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
docked	CODE
tree	CODE
control	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
left	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
creating	CODE
container	CODE
controls	CODE
that	CODE
correspond	CODE
to	CODE
each	CODE
node	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
tree	CODE
when	CODE
a	CODE
node	CODE
is	CODE
selected	CODE
the	CODE
app	CODE
brings	CODE
that	CODE
node's	CODE
corresponding	CODE
container	CODE
control	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
front	CODE
moves	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
position	CODE
and	CODE
maximizes	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
window	CODE
this	CODE
seems	CODE
really	CODE
really	CODE
clunky	CODE
while	CODE
designing	CODE
it	CODE
it	CODE
basically	CODE
means	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
tons	CODE
of	CODE
container	CODE
controls	CODE
beyond	CODE
the	CODE
edge	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
window	CODE
during	CODE
design	CODE
time	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
keep	CODE
scrolling	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
window	CODE
over	CODE
to	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
them	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
totally	CODE
makes	CODE
sense	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
i'm	CODE
writing	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
maybe	CODE
this	CODE
visual	CODE
for	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
will	CODE
make	CODE
more	CODE
sense	CODE
basically	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
huge	CODE
form	CODE
with	CODE
container	CODE
controls	CODE
all	CODE
over	CODE
the	CODE
place	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
run-time	CODE
reformatting	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
all	CODE
work	CODE
this	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
extra	CODE
work	CODE
am	CODE
i	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
totally	CODE
stupid	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
some	CODE
obvious	CODE
easier	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
that	CODE
i'm	CODE
missing	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
providers	CODE
a	CODE
fair	CODE
bit	CODE
lately	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
came	CODE
across	CODE
an	CODE
interesting	CODE
situation	CODE
where	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
abstract	CODE
class	CODE
that	CODE
had	CODE
an	CODE
abstract	CODE
static	CODE
method	CODE
i	CODE
read	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
posts	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
topic	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
made	CODE
sense	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
clear	CODE
explanation	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
resolve	CODE
a	CODE
domain	CODE
name	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE

a	CODE

what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
equivalent	CODE
of	CODE
php's	CODE
$_post	CODE
after	CODE
searching	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
hour	CODE
i'm	CODE
still	CODE
nowhere	CODE
closer	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
class-like	CODE
behavior	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
common	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
prototype	CODE
based	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
closure	CODE
based	CODE
approaches	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
for	CODE
various	CODE
reasons	CODE
the	CODE
latter	CODE
is	CODE
faster	CODE
but	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
frequently	CODE
do	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
prototype	CODE
version	CODE
and	CODE
was	CODE
curious	CODE
as	CODE
to	CODE
what	CODE
other	CODE
people	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
my	CODE
team	CODE
is	CODE
currently	CODE
developing	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
dll	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
perform	CODE
all	CODE
database	CODE
access	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
can	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
trusted	CODE
connection	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
is	CODE
behind	CODE
a	CODE
firewall	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
domain	CODE
server	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
connection	CODE
string	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
db	CODE
username	CODE
and	CODE
password	CODE
the	CODE
dll	CODE
currently	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
connection	CODE
string	CODE
hard	CODE
coded	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
when	CODE
we	CODE
launch	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
assembly	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
disassembled	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
username	CODE
and	CODE
password	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
right	CODE
there	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
open	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
requirements	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
password	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
changed	CODE
once	CODE
every	CODE
few	CODE
months	CODE
so	CODE
we	CODE
would	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
roll	CODE
that	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
our	CODE
internal	CODE
user	CODE
base	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
password	CODE
encrypted	CODE
in	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
easily	CODE
distribute	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
entire	CODE
user	CODE
base	CODE
without	CODE
storing	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
assembly	CODE
update	CODE
thanks	CODE
to	CODE
everyone	CODE
who's	CODE
answered	CODE
i'll	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
answer	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
questions	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
dll	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
by	CODE
both	CODE
aspnet	CODE
webforms	CODE
and	CODE
vbnet	CODE
winforms	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
that	CODE
applications	CODE
can	CODE
have	CODE
their	CODE
own	CODE
config	CODE
files	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
seen	CODE
anything	CODE
on	CODE
config	CODE
files	CODE
for	CODE
dlls	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
get	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
jon	CODE
galloway	CODE
post	CODE
at	CODE
work	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
judge	CODE
if	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
development	CODE
standpoint	CODE
we	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
web	CODE
services	CODE
inhouse	CODE
but	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
providing	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
third	CODE
parties	CODE
sometime	CODE
next	CODE
year	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
think	CODE
impersonation	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
because	CODE
we	CODE
can't	CODE
authenticate	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
firewall	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
or	CODE
former	CODE
user	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
an	CODE
attacker	CODE
we're	CODE
keeping	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
everyone	CODE
even	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
robust	CODE
and	CODE
fast	CODE
computer	CODE
pentium	CODE
dual	CODE
core	CODE
20	CODE
with	CODE
2gb	CODE
ram	CODE
i'm	CODE
always	CODE
searching	CODE
for	CODE
lightweight	CODE
software	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
runs	CODE
fast	CODE
even	CODE
when	CODE
many	CODE
apps	CODE
are	CODE
up	CODE
and	CODE
running	CODE
simultaneously	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
few	CODE
weeks	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
migrating	CODE
gradually	CODE
to	CODE
linux	CODE
and	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
install	CODE
a	CODE
free	CODE
lightweight	CODE
yet	CODE
useful	CODE
ide	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
on	CODE
c++	CODE
and	CODE
php	CODE
sintax	CODE
highlighting	CODE
and	CODE
code	CODE
completition	CODE
tips	CODE
are	CODE
must-haves	CODE
so	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
receive	CODE
some	CODE
suggestions	CODE
from	CODE
you	CODE
guys	CODE
exceptions	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
don't	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
caught	CODE
no	CODE
compile	CODE
time	CODE
errors	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
calling	CODE
function	CODE
so	CODE
it's	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
developer's	CODE
judgment	CODE
whether	CODE
to	CODE
catch	CODE
it	CODE
using	CODE
trycatch	CODE
unlike	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
one	CODE
can	CODE
ensure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
exceptions	CODE
thrown	CODE
are	CODE
always	CODE
caught	CODE
using	CODE
trycatch	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
calling	CODE
function	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
few	CODE
months	CODE
i	CODE
began	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
serious	CODE
javascript	CODE
development	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
began	CODE
developing	CODE
xul	CODE
applications	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
notepad++	CODE
as	CODE
my	CODE
editor	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
pretty	CODE
appalled	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
tell	CODE
that	CODE
venkmanjavascript	CODE
debugger	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
tool	CODE
for	CODE
debugging	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
poor	CODE
replacement	CODE
to	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
for	CODE
net	CODE
languages	CODE
am	CODE
i	CODE
missing	CODE
something	CODE
what	CODE
are	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
tools	CODE
and	CODE
best	CODE
practices	CODE
for	CODE
javascript	CODE
development	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
some	CODE
killer	CODE
idedebuggereditor	CODE
combination	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
aware	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
easier	CODE
than	CODE
this	CODE
though	CODE
i've	CODE
heard	CODE
some	CODE
mention	CODE
of	CODE
eclipse	CODE
-	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
choice	CODE
here	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
very	CODE
little	CODE
about	CODE
it	CODE
edit	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
pointed	CODE
out	CODE
firebug	CODE
-	CODE
i	CODE
guess	CODE
my	CODE
problem	CODE
was	CODE
that	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
actually	CODE
using	CODE
javascript	CODE
for	CODE
web	CODE
development	CODE
for	CODE
which	CODE
firebug	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
tool	CODE
--	CODE
instead	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
for	CODE
xul	CODE
development	CODE
in	CODE
xulrunner	CODE
which	CODE
may	CODE
simply	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
weakness	CODE
or	CODE
immaturity	CODE
of	CODE

what	CODE

problem	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
only	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
functionality	CODE
yes	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
have	CODE
million	CODE
keyword	CODE
arguments	CODE
and	CODE
even	CODE
more	CODE
if	CODE
statements	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
thinking	CODE
more	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
oriented	CODE
approach	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
page	CODE
that	CODE
displays	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
this	CODE
page	CODE
is	CODE
very	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
page	CODE
that	CODE
displays	CODE
a	CODE
group	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
still	CODE
not	CODE
so	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
use	CODE
another	CODE
data	CODE
model	CODE
group	CODE
also	CODE
has	CODE
members	CODE
etc	CODE
one	CODE
way	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
point	CODE
views	CODE
to	CODE
class	CODE
methods	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
extend	CODE
that	CODE
class	CODE
has	CODE
anyone	CODE
tried	CODE
this	CODE
approach	CODE
or	CODE
has	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
idea	CODE
i'm	CODE
downloading	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
page	CODE
tag	CODE
soup	CODE
html	CODE
with	CODE
xmlhttprequest	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
take	CODE
the	CODE
output	CODE
and	CODE
turn	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
dom	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
then	CODE
run	CODE
xpath	CODE
queries	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
convert	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
into	CODE
dom	CODE
object	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
general	CODE
solution	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
hidden	CODE
iframe	CODE
and	CODE
throw	CODE
the	CODE
contents	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
into	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
talk	CODE
of	CODE
updating	CODE
domparser	CODE
to	CODE
support	CODE
texthtml	CODE
but	CODE
as	CODE
of	CODE
firefox	CODE
301	CODE
you	CODE
still	CODE
get	CODE
an	CODE
ns_error_not_implemented	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
try	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
option	CODE
besides	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
hidden	CODE
iframe	CODE
trick	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
iframe	CODE
trick	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
works	CODE
outside	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
of	CODE
any	CODE
currently	CODE
open	CODE
tabs	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
closing	CODE
tabs	CODE
won't	CODE
screw	CODE
up	CODE
code	CODE
etc	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE
why	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
other	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
iframe	CODE
hack	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
robust	CODE
solution	CODE
then	CODE
i'd	CODE
rather	CODE
keep	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
else	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
performant	CODE
reasonably	CODE
robust	CODE
rng	CODE
using	CODE
no	CODE
special	CODE
hardware	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
mathematical	CODE
methods	CODE
mersenne	CODE
twister	CODE
etc	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
collect	CODE
entropy	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
machine	CODE
whatever	CODE
on	CODE
linuxetc	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
drand48	CODE
which	CODE
generates	CODE
48	CODE
random	CODE
bits	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
similar	CODE
functionclass	CODE
for	CODE
c++	CODE
or	CODE
c#	CODE
which	CODE
can	CODE
generate	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
32	CODE
bits	CODE
of	CODE
randomness	CODE
and	CODE
which	CODE
low-order	CODE
bits	CODE
are	CODE
equally	CODE
as	CODE
random	CODE
as	CODE
high-order	CODE
bits	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
cryptographically	CODE
secure	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
must	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE

be	CODE
based	CODE

the	CODE
c-language	CODE
rand	CODE

net	CODE
systemrandom	CODE
any	CODE

would	CODE
be	CODE
appreciated	CODE
failing	CODE
that	CODE
what	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE

should	CODE
i	CODE
be	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
format	CODE
a	CODE

the	CODE

win32_operatingsystem	CODE
only	CODE

i	CODE
quickly	CODE
wrote	CODE

a	CODE

so	CODE
far	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
how	CODE
much	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
looking	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
registry	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
standard	CODE
practice	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
method	CODE
edit	CODE
wow	CODE
that	CODE
code	CODE
looks	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
prettier	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
preview	CODE
i'll	CODE
consider	CODE
linking	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
pastebin	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
next	CODE
time	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
an	CODE
evalsomething	CODE
to	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
dynamically	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
exactly	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
variable	CODE
say	CODE
i	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
multiple	CODE
properties	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
names	CODE
property1	CODE
property2	CODE
property3	CODE
etc	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
perform	CODE
some	CODE
operations	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
property*i*	CODE
property	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
i	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
really	CODE
simple	CODE
with	CODE
javascript	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
with	CODE
c#	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
saw	CODE
a	CODE
comment	CODE
of	CODE
suggesting	CODE
j#	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
made	CODE
me	CODE
wonder	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
beneficial	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
j#	CODE
over	CODE
java	CODE
so	CODE
my	CODE
feeling	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
reason	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
even	CODE
consider	CODE
using	CODE
j#	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
management	CODE
has	CODE
decreed	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
company	CODE
should	CODE
jump	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
bandwagon	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
bandwagon	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
j#	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
effectively	CODE
losing	CODE
the	CODE
biggest	CODE
benefit	CODE
of	CODE
picking	CODE
java	CODE
rich	CODE
cross	CODE
platform	CODE
support	CODE
sure	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
mono	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
as	CODE
richly	CODE
supported	CODE
or	CODE
as	CODE
full	CODE
featured	CODE
right	CODE
i	CODE
remember	CODE
hearing	CODE
forms	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
fully	CODE
perhaps	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
supported	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
bash	CODE
net	CODE
here	CODE
i'm	CODE
just	CODE
saying	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
route	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
use	CODE
c#	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
route	CODE
why	CODE
would	CODE
j#	CODE
enter	CODE
the	CODE
picture	CODE
i'm	CODE
hoping	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
some	CODE
real	CODE
world	CODE
cases	CODE
here	CODE
so	CODE
please	CODE
especially	CODE
respond	CODE
if	CODE
you've	CODE
actually	CODE
used	CODE
j#	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
project	CODE
and	CODE
why	CODE
an	CODE
mfc	CODE
application	CODE
that	CODE
i'm	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
migrate	CODE
uses	CODE
afxexth	CODE
which	CODE
causes	CODE
_afxdll	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
set	CODE
which	CODE
causes	CODE
this	CODE
error	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
set	CODE
mt	CODE
please	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
md	CODE
switch	CODE
for	CODE
_afxdll	CODE
builds	CODE
my	CODE
research	CODE
to	CODE
date	CODE
indicates	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
impossible	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
for	CODE
execution	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
nt	CODE
40	CODE
using	CODE
visual	CODE

c++	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
2005	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
really	CODE
true	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
workaround	CODE
available	CODE
i'm	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
website	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
switch	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE

on	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
date	CODE
the	CODE
site's	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
semantic	CODE
html	CODE

so	CODE
the	CODE
change	CODE
should	CODE
just	CODE
require	CODE
a	CODE
css	CODE
reference	CODE
change	CODE
i'm	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
designer	CODE
who	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
how	CODE
it's	CODE
looking	CODE

well	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
client	CODE
who	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
review	CODE
content	CODE
updates	CODE

the	CODE

look	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
design	CODE
progress	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
look	CODE
i'm	CODE
planning	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
magic	CODE
querystring	CODE
value	CODE
and	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE

we're	CODE
working	CODE
in	CODE
aspnet	CODE
35	CODE
any	CODE
recommendations	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
mention	CODE
that	CODE
we're	CODE
using	CODE
ie	CODE
conditional	CODE
comments	CODE
for	CODE
ie87and	CODE
6	CODE
support	CODE
i	CODE
may	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
a	CODE
replacement	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
about	CODE
calling	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
given	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
function's	CODE
name	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
python	CODE
program	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
module	CODE
foo	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
whose	CODE
contents	CODE
are	CODE
bar	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
about	CODE
calling	CODE
foobar	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
why	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
just	CODE
use	CODE
eval	CODE
i	CODE
figured	CODE
out	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE
eval	CODE
to	CODE
define	CODE
a	CODE
temp	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
returns	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
function	CODE
call	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
hoping	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
elegant	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
realize	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
newbie	CODE
question	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
solution	CODE
-	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
there	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
one	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
import	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
strongly-typed	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
again	CODE
simple	CODE
=	CODE
better	CODE
how	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
prototype	CODE
methods	CODE
in	CODE
c#net	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
trim	CODE
method	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
object	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
go	CODE
about	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c#net	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
setter	CODE
method	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
property	CODE
and	CODE
null	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
appropriate	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
particular	CODE
property	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
always	CODE
been	CODE
torn	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
situation	CODE
should	CODE
i	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
illegalargumentexception	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
nullpointerexception	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
javadocs	CODE
both	CODE
seem	CODE
appropriate	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
understood	CODE
standard	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
just	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
things	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
do	CODE
whatever	CODE
you	CODE
prefer	CODE
and	CODE
both	CODE
are	CODE
really	CODE
correct	CODE
is	CODE
compileassemblyfromdom	CODE
faster	CODE
than	CODE
compileassemblyfromsource	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
presumably	CODE
bypasses	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
front-end	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
coldfusion	CODE
to	CODE
populate	CODE
a	CODE
template	CODE
that	CODE
includes	CODE
html	CODE
lists	CODE
ul's	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
these	CODE
aren't	CODE
that	CODE
long	CODE
but	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
have	CODE
ridiculously	CODE
long	CODE
lengths	CODE
and	CODE
could	CODE
really	CODE
stand	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
in	CODE
2-3	CODE
columns	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
an	CODE
html	CODE
coldfusion	CODE
or	CODE
perhaps	CODE
javascript	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
jquery	CODE
available	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
easily	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
worth	CODE
some	CODE
over-complicated	CODE
heavy	CODE
weight	CODE
solution	CODE
to	CODE
save	CODE
some	CODE
scrolling	CODE
i	CODE
saw	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
another	CODE
question	CODE
in	CODE
reference	CODE
to	CODE
shortcomings	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
spec	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
shortcomings	CODE
and	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
subtle	CODE
topic	CODE
check	CODE
this	CODE
out	CODE
here	CODE
long	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
printed	CODE
haven't	CODE
checked	CODE
it	CODE
myself	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
choses	CODE
>widening	CODE
over	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
be	CODE
careful	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
or	CODE
don't	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
are	CODE
we	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE
widening	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
something	CODE
else	CODE
entirely	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
initial	CODE
scanning	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
agree	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
statement	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
output	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
long	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
basis	CODE
of	CODE
i	CODE
being	CODE
declared	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
changed	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
output	CODE
would	CODE
print	CODE
integer	CODE
what's	CODE
really	CODE
going	CODE
on	CODE
here	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
nothing	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
compilersbytecode	CODE
interpreters	CODE
for	CODE
java	CODE
i'm	CODE
wondering	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
release	CODE
build	CODE
that	CODE
includes	CODE
all	CODE
necessary	CODE
dll	CODE
files	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
exe	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
program	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
run	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
non-development	CODE
machine	CODE
without	CODE
it	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
install	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
redistributable	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
target	CODE
machine	CODE
without	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
error	CODE
message	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
configuration	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
correct	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
reinstall	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
cc++	CODE
programs	CODE
that	CODE
take	CODE
input	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
midi	CODE
device	CODE
the	CODE
midi	CODE
device	CODE
connects	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
pc	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
usb	CODE
connector	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
cc++	CODE
implemented	CODE
library	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
midi	CODE
signals	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
midi	CODE
device	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
usb	CODE
port	CODE
i'm	CODE
happy	CODE
manipulating	CODE
the	CODE
midi	CODE
data	CODE
once	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
its	CODE
capture	CODE
i'm	CODE
planning	CODE
on	CODE
writing	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
bloodshed	CODE
dev-c++	CODE
ide	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
xp	CODE
how	CODE
would	CODE
one	CODE
display	CODE
any	CODE
add	CODE
content	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
dynamic	CODE
aspx	CODE
page	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
systemwebhttpresponse	CODE
pageresponse	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
stored	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
server	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
request	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
allow	CODE
people	CODE
to	CODE
hit	CODE
a	CODE
url	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
httpwwwfoocomimage=testjpg	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
display	CODE
in	CODE
their	CODE
browser	CODE
so	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
know	CODE
this	CODE
revolves	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
responsecontenttype	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
images	CODE
of	CODE
type	CODE
gifjpegpng	CODE
all	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
tested	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
bit	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
swf	CODE
or	CODE
ico	CODE
files	CODE
gives	CODE
me	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
little	CODE
error	CODE
using	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
flash	CODE
files	CODE
to	CODE
play	CODE
but	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
images	CODE
are	CODE
messed	CODE
so	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
easily	CODE
choose	CODE
the	CODE
contenttype	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
prototyping	CODE
some	CODE
c#	CODE
3	CODE
collection	CODE
filters	CODE
and	CODE
came	CODE
across	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
products	CODE
now	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
linq	CODE
to	CODE
filter	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
as	CODE
expected	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
where	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
combined	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
lambda	CODE
the	CODE
filter	CODE
works	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
question	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
and	CODE
why	CODE
use	CODE
one	CODE
over	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
why	CODE
are	CODE
pointers	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
leading	CODE
factor	CODE
of	CODE
confusion	CODE
for	CODE
many	CODE
new	CODE
and	CODE
even	CODE
old	CODE
college	CODE
level	CODE
students	CODE
in	CODE
c	CODE
or	CODE
c++	CODE
are	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
tools	CODE
or	CODE
thought	CODE
processes	CODE
that	CODE
helped	CODE
you	CODE
understand	CODE
how	CODE
pointers	CODE
work	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
variable	CODE
function	CODE
and	CODE
beyond	CODE
level	CODE
what	CODE
are	CODE
some	CODE
good	CODE
practice	CODE
things	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
to	CODE
bring	CODE
somebody	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
level	CODE
of	CODE
ah-hah	CODE
i	CODE
got	CODE
it	CODE
without	CODE
getting	CODE
them	CODE
bogged	CODE
down	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
overall	CODE
concept	CODE
basically	CODE
drill	CODE
like	CODE
scenarios	CODE
is	CODE
anyone	CODE
successfully	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
latest	CODE
64-bit	CODE
ganymede	CODE
release	CODE
of	CODE
eclipse	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
xp	CODE
or	CODE
vista	CODE
64-bit	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
normal	CODE
eclipse	CODE
34	CODE
distribution	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
32bit	CODE
jdk	CODE
and	CODE
launch	CODE
compile	CODE
my	CODE
apps	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
64bit	CODE
jdk	CODE
our	CODE
previous	CODE
experience	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
64bit	CODE
eclipse	CODE
distro	CODE
is	CODE
unstable	CODE
for	CODE
us	CODE
so	CODE
i'm	CODE
curious	CODE
if	CODE
anyone	CODE
is	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
successfully	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
jdk	CODE
160_05	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
subscribe	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
event	CODE
on	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
essentially	CODE
handing	CODE
over	CODE
control	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
callback	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
event	CODE
source	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
idea	CODE
whether	CODE
that	CODE
event	CODE
source	CODE
will	CODE
choose	CODE
to	CODE
trigger	CODE
the	CODE
event	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
thread	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
callback	CODE
is	CODE
invoked	CODE
you	CODE
cannot	CODE
assume	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
make	CODE
update	CODE
controls	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
form	CODE
because	CODE
sometimes	CODE
those	CODE
controls	CODE
will	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
expection	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
event	CODE
callback	CODE
was	CODE
called	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
thread	CODE
different	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
was	CODE
run	CODE
on	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
winforms	CODE
program	CODE
written	CODE
on	CODE
net	CODE
2	CODE
which	CODE
hosts	CODE
a	CODE
webbrowser	CODE
control	CODE
and	CODE
renders	CODE
aspnet	CODE
pages	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
known	CODE
server	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
drag	CODE
say	CODE
a	CODE
tree	CODE
node	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
treeview	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
winforms	CODE
app	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
location	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
hosted	CODE
web	CODE
page	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
it	CODE
trigger	CODE
a	CODE
javascript	CODE
event	CODE
there	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
idochostuihandler	CODE
interface	CODE
and	CODE
getting	CODE
drag\drop	CODE
events	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
browser	CODE
control	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
navigatejavascriptfire_event	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

to	CODE
execute	CODE
a	CODE
script	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
this	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
only	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
drop	CODE
data	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
one	CODE
solution	CODE
i	CODE
suppose	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
bite	CODE
the	CODE
bullet	CODE
and	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
browser	CODE
plugin	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
activex	CODE
control	CODE
embed	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
location	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
drop	CODE
to	CODE
and	CODE
let	CODE
that	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
needed	CODE
drag\drop	CODE
interfaces	CODE
would	CODE
that	CODE
work	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
cleaner	CODE
approach	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
take	CODE
advantage	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
fact	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
browser	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
hosted	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
app	CODE
and	CODE
provide	CODE
some	CODE
further	CODE
level	CODE
of	CODE
interaction	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
prolite	CODE
led	CODE
sign	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
show	CODE
scrolling	CODE
search	CODE
queries	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
apache	CODE
logs	CODE
and	CODE
other	CODE
fun	CODE
statistics	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
my	CODE
g5	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
usb	CODE
to	CODE
serial	CODE
dongle	CODE
it	CODE
shows	CODE
up	CODE
as	CODE
devcuusbserial	CODE
and	CODE
devttyusbserial	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
everything	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
hunky-dory	CODE
everything	CODE
also	CODE
works	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
tool	CODE
to	CODE
talk	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
run	CODE
this	CODE
piece	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
while	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
mentioned	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
tool	CODE
everthing	CODE
also	CODE
works	CODE
but	CODE
as	CODE
soon	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
disconnect	CODE
the	CODE
tool	CODE
the	CODE
connection	CODE
gets	CODE
lost	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
magicks	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
perform	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
talking	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
tool	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
permissions	CODE
problem	CODE
also	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
devcuusbserial	CODE
and	CODE
devttyusbserial	CODE
nope	CODE
no	CODE
serial	CODE
numbers	CODE
the	CODE
thing	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
persists	CODE
even	CODE
with	CODE
sudo-running	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
script	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
thing	CODE
that	CODE
makes	CODE
it	CODE
go	CODE
through	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
open	CODE
the	CODE
connection	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
gui	CODE
tool	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
mentioned	CODE
given	CODE
a	CODE
datetime	CODE
representing	CODE
a	CODE
person's	CODE
birthday	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
calculate	CODE
their	CODE
age	CODE
should	CODE
you	CODE
set	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
objects	CODE
to	CODE
null	CODE
nothing	CODE
in	CODE
vbnet	CODE
once	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
finished	CODE
with	CODE
them	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
essential	CODE
to	CODE
dispose	CODE
of	CODE
any	CODE
instances	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
that	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
idisposable	CODE
interface	CODE
to	CODE
release	CODE
some	CODE
resources	CODE
although	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
can	CODE
still	CODE
be	CODE
something	CODE
after	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
disposed	CODE
hence	CODE
the	CODE
isdisposed	CODE
property	CODE
in	CODE
forms	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
assume	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
still	CODE
reside	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
in	CODE
part	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
when	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
goes	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
scope	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
then	CODE
marked	CODE
for	CODE
collection	CODE
ready	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
pass	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
garbage	CODE
collector	CODE
although	CODE
this	CODE
may	CODE
take	CODE
time	CODE
so	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
mind	CODE
will	CODE
setting	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
null	CODE
speed	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
releasing	CODE
the	CODE
memory	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
out	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
longer	CODE
in	CODE
scope	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
they	CODE
any	CODE
bad	CODE
side	CODE
effects	CODE
msdn	CODE
articles	CODE
never	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
examples	CODE
and	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
cannot	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
harm	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
come	CODE
across	CODE
a	CODE
mixture	CODE
of	CODE
opinions	CODE
so	CODE
any	CODE
comments	CODE
are	CODE
useful	CODE
what	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
fill	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
struct	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
byte[]	CODE
array	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
was	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
cc++	CODE
struct	CODE
the	CODE
c	CODE
struct	CODE
would	CODE
look	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
my	CODE
c	CODE
is	CODE
very	CODE
rusty	CODE
and	CODE
would	CODE
fill	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
copy	CODE
oldstuff	CODE
to	CODE
newstuff	CODE
if	CODE
oldstuff	CODE
was	CODE
passed	CODE
as	CODE
byte[]	CODE
array	CODE
i'm	CODE
currently	CODE
doing	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
feels	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
clunky	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
better	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
accomplish	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
binaryreader	CODE
class	CODE
offer	CODE
any	CODE
performance	CODE
gains	CODE
over	CODE
pinning	CODE
the	CODE
memory	CODE
and	CODE
using	CODE
marshalptrstructure	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
compress	CODE
or	CODE
decompress	CODE
files	CODE
and	CODE
folders	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
quickly	CODE
handling	CODE
large	CODE
files	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
necessary	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
an	CODE
understandable	CODE
explanation	CODE
of	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
use	CODE
python's	CODE
itertoolsgroupby	CODE
function	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
-	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
the	CODE
children	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
objectified	CODE
lxml	CODE
element	CODE
divide	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
groups	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
some	CODE
criteria	CODE
then	CODE
later	CODE
iterate	CODE
over	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
these	CODE
groups	CODE
separately	CODE
i've	CODE
reviewed	CODE
the	CODE
documentation	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
examples	CODE
but	CODE
i've	CODE
had	CODE
trouble	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
apply	CODE
them	CODE
beyond	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
numbers	CODE
so	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
itertoolsgroupby	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
another	CODE
technique	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
using	CODE
pointers	CODE
to	CODE
good	CODE
prerequisite	CODE
reading	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
be	CODE
appreciated	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
control	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
modelled	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
combobox	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
render	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
border	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
standard	CODE
windows	CODE
combobox	CODE
specifically	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
followed	CODE
the	CODE
msdn	CODE
documentation	CODE
and	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
rendering	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
correct	CODE
except	CODE
for	CODE
rendering	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
disabled	CODE
just	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
clear	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
system	CODE
with	CODE
visual	CODE
styles	CODE
enabled	CODE
also	CODE
all	CODE
parts	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
render	CODE
properly	CODE
except	CODE
the	CODE
border	CODE
around	CODE
a	CODE
disabled	CODE
control	CODE
which	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
match	CODE
the	CODE
disabled	CODE
combobox	CODE
border	CODE
colour	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
visualstylerenderer	CODE
class	CODE
msdn	CODE
suggests	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
visualstyleelementtextbox	CODE
element	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
textbox	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
combobox	CODE
control	CODE
but	CODE
a	CODE

a	CODE

differently	CODE
one	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
light	CODE
grey	CODE

the	CODE
other	CODE
a	CODE

how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
correct	CODE

in	CODE
a	CODE

2005	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
split	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
access	CODE
item	CODE
x	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
take	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
hello	CODE
john	CODE
smith	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
split	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
by	CODE
a	CODE
space	CODE
and	CODE
access	CODE
the	CODE
item	CODE
at	CODE
index	CODE
1	CODE
which	CODE
should	CODE
return	CODE
john	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
object	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
stored	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
variable	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
can't	CODE
even	CODE
be	CODE
explicitly	CODE
cast	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
results	CODE
in	CODE
cannot	CODE
implicitly	CODE
convert	CODE
type	CODE
systemcollectionsgenericliststring	CODE
to	CODE
systemcollectionsgenericlistobject	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
results	CODE
in	CODE
cannot	CODE
convert	CODE
type	CODE
systemcollectionsgenericliststring	CODE
to	CODE
systemcollectionsgenericlistobject	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
by	CODE
pulling	CODE
everything	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
putting	CODE
it	CODE
back	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
time	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
rather	CODE
convoluted	CODE
solution	CODE
ok	CODE
i'm	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
developer	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
find	CODE
myself	CODE
dabbling	CODE
in	CODE
windows	CODE
forms	CODE
projects	CODE
every	CODE
now	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
one	CODE
thing	CODE
that	CODE
confounds	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
day	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
assume	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
doing	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
so	CODE
now	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
2	CODE
combo	CODE
boxes	CODE
bound	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
array	CODE
and	CODE
everything	CODE
works	CODE
fine	CODE
but	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
one	CODE
combo	CODE
box	CODE
it	CODE
changes	CODE
both	CODE
combo	CODE
boxes	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
one	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
selected	CODE
now	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
arrays	CODE
are	CODE
always	CODE
passed	CODE
by	CODE
reference	CODE
learned	CODE
that	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
c	CODE
d	CODE
but	CODE
why	CODE
on	CODE
earth	CODE
would	CODE
the	CODE
combo	CODE
boxes	CODE
change	CODE
together	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
believe	CODE
the	CODE
combo	CODE
box	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
modifying	CODE
the	CODE
collection	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
work	CODE
around	CODE
don't	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
achieve	CODE
the	CODE
funcionality	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
expected	CODE
desired	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
argb	CODE
color	CODE
when	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
painted	CODE
on	CODE
top	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
color	CODE
the	CODE
colors	CODE
will	CODE
blend	CODE
so	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
blended	CODE
with	CODE
white	CODE
the	CODE
resulting	CODE
color	CODE
is	CODE
colorfromargb255	CODE
162	CODE
133	CODE
255	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
should	CODE
work	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
torgb's	CODE
implementation	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
robust	CODE
easy-to-use	CODE
regular	CODE
expression	CODE
evaluator	CODE
for	CODE
native	CODE
c++	CODE
either	CODE
platform-independent	CODE
or	CODE
windows-specific	CODE
requirements	CODE
can't	CODE
use	CODE
boost	CODE
or	CODE
ace	CODE
regex	CODE
libraries	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
can't	CODE
use	CODE
net	CODE
regex	CODE
or	CODE
any	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
requirement	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
standalone	CODE
and	CODE
open	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
delete	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
locked	CODE
by	CODE
another	CODE
process	CODE
using	CODE
c#	CODE
i	CODE
suspect	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
which	CODE
process	CODE
is	CODE
locking	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
perhaps	CODE
by	CODE
tracking	CODE
the	CODE
handles	CODE
although	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
then	CODE
close	CODE
that	CODE
process	CODE
before	CODE
being	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
complete	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
delete	CODE
using	CODE
filedelete	CODE
i	CODE
plan	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
storing	CODE
all	CODE
my	CODE
config	CODE
settings	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
application's	CODE
appconfig	CODE
section	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
configurationmanagerappsettings	CODE
class	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
changes	CODE
settings	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
app's	CODE
ui	CODE
clicking	CODE
checkboxes	CODE
choosing	CODE
radio	CODE
buttons	CODE
etc	CODE
i	CODE
plan	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
writing	CODE
those	CODE
changes	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
time	CODE
while	CODE
the	CODE
program	CODE
is	CODE
running	CODE
i	CODE
plan	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
accessing	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
constantly	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
process	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
constantly	CODE
processing	CODE
data	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
settings	CODE
via	CODE
the	CODE
ui	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
affect	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
processing	CODE
in	CODE
real-time	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
why	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
accessing	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
constantly	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
idea	CODE
with	CODE
regard	CODE
to	CODE
performance	CODE
using	CODE
appsettings	CODE
is	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
and	CODE
access	CODE
configuration	CODE
settings	CODE
when	CODE
writing	CODE
net	CODE
apps	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
worry	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
method	CODE
wasn't	CODE
intended	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
constant	CODE
load	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
settings	CODE
being	CODE
constantly	CODE
read	CODE
if	CODE
anyone	CODE
has	CODE
experience	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
greatly	CODE
appreciate	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
update	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
probably	CODE
clarify	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
points	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
so	CODE
connecting	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
overkill	CODE
simply	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
configuration	CODE
settings	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
forms	CODE
application	CODE
according	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
msdn	CODE
documention	CODE
the	CODE
configurationmanager	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
application	CODE
level	CODE
settings	CODE
but	CODE
user	CODE
settings	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
especially	CODE
important	CODE
if	CODE
for	CODE
instance	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
installed	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
partial-trust	CODE
application	CODE
update	CODE
2	CODE
i	CODE
accepted	CODE
lomaxx's	CODE
answer	CODE
because	CODE
properties	CODE
does	CODE
indeed	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
solution	CODE
without	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
any	CODE
additional	CODE
layers	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
application	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
properties	CODE
it	CODE
already	CODE
does	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
caching	CODE
that	CODE
others	CODE
suggested	CODE
this	CODE
means	CODE
any	CODE
changes	CODE
and	CODE
subsequent	CODE
reads	CODE
are	CODE
all	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
making	CODE
it	CODE
extremely	CODE
fast	CODE
properties	CODE
only	CODE
writes	CODE
the	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
disk	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
explicitly	CODE
tell	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
means	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
make	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
config	CODE
settings	CODE
on-the-fly	CODE
at	CODE
run	CODE
time	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
only	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
final	CODE
save	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
disk	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
program	CODE
exits	CODE
just	CODE
to	CODE
verify	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
actually	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
load	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
some	CODE
testing	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
laptop	CODE
and	CODE
was	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
750000	CODE
reads	CODE
and	CODE
7500	CODE
writes	CODE
per	CODE
second	CODE
using	CODE
properties	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
so	CODE
far	CODE
above	CODE
and	CODE
beyond	CODE
what	CODE
my	CODE
application	CODE
will	CODE
ever	CODE
even	CODE
come	CODE
close	CODE
to	CODE
needing	CODE
that	CODE

compare	CODE

several	CODE

well	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
naive	CODE
algorithm	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
made	CODE
which	CODE
only	CODE

for	CODE
files	CODE
that	CODE

kept	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
is	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
grab	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
four	CODE
bytes	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
old	CODE
file	CODE
call	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
add	CODE
those	CODE

to	CODE
a	CODE

key	CODE

is	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
grabbed	CODE
those	CODE

add	CODE

the	CODE

repeat	CODE
steps	CODE
1-3	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
4-byte	CODE
blocks	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
old	CODE

from	CODE
the	CODE
start	CODE

the	CODE

there	CODE
are	CODE
several	CODE

the	CODE
two	CODE

steps	CODE
5-8	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
rest	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
file	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
somewhat	CODE
like	CODE
compression	CODE
without	CODE
windowing	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
memory	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
however	CODE
fairly	CODE
fast	CODE
and	CODE
produces	CODE
quite	CODE
small	CODE
patches	CODE
as	CODE
long	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
codes	CODE
output	CODE
minimal	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
memory-efficient	CODE
algorithm	CODE
uses	CODE
windowing	CODE
but	CODE
produces	CODE
much	CODE
bigger	CODE
patch	CODE
files	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
nuances	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
algorithm	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
skipped	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
post	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
post	CODE
more	CODE
details	CODE
if	CODE
necessary	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
however	CODE
feel	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
algorithm	CODE
altogether	CODE
so	CODE
improving	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
algorithm	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
not	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
me	CODE
far	CODE
enough	CODE
edit	CODE
#1	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
detailed	CODE
description	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
algorithm	CODE
first	CODE
combine	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
files	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
big	CODE
file	CODE
remember	CODE
the	CODE
cut-point	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
files	CODE
secondly	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
grab	CODE
4	CODE
bytes	CODE
and	CODE
add	CODE
their	CODE
position	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
step	CODE
for	CODE
everything	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE

thirdly	CODE

where	CODE
the	CODE

starts	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
with	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
locate	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
combination	CODE
of	CODE
4	CODE
bytes	CODE
and	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
longest	CODE
match	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
we	CODE
only	CODE
consider	CODE
positions	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
old	CODE

or	CODE
from	CODE
earlier	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
file	CODE
than	CODE
we're	CODE
currently	CODE
at	CODE
this	CODE
ensures	CODE
that	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
reuse	CODE

in	CODE
both	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE

file	CODE
during	CODE
patch	CODE
application	CODE
edit	CODE
#2	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
algorithm	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
warning	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
certificate	CODE
having	CODE
some	CODE
problems	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
resolve	CODE
that	CODE
so	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
being	CODE
just	CODE
accept	CODE
the	CODE
certificate	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
uses	CODE
lots	CODE
of	CODE
other	CODE
types	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
rest	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
library	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
file	CODE
isn't	CODE
all	CODE
it	CODE
takes	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
the	CODE
algorithm	CODE
implementation	CODE
@lomaxx	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
tried	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
documentation	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
algorithm	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
subversion	CODE
called	CODE
xdelta	CODE
but	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
already	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
the	CODE
algorithm	CODE
works	CODE
the	CODE
documents	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
fail	CODE
to	CODE
tell	CODE
me	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
or	CODE
perhaps	CODE
i'm	CODE
just	CODE
dense	CODE
i	CODE
took	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
peek	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
algorithm	CODE
from	CODE
that	CODE
site	CODE
you	CODE
gave	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
not	CODE
usable	CODE
a	CODE
comment	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
binary	CODE
diff	CODE
file	CODE
says	CODE
finding	CODE
an	CODE
optimal	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
differences	CODE
requires	CODE
quadratic	CODE
time	CODE
relative	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
size	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
becomes	CODE
unusable	CODE
very	CODE
quickly	CODE
my	CODE
needs	CODE
aren't	CODE
optimal	CODE
though	CODE
so	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
practical	CODE
solution	CODE
thanks	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
though	CODE
added	CODE
a	CODE
bookmark	CODE
to	CODE
his	CODE
utilities	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
ever	CODE
need	CODE
them	CODE
edit	CODE
#1	CODE
note	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
his	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
some	CODE
ideas	CODE
and	CODE
i'll	CODE
also	CODE
send	CODE
him	CODE
an	CODE
email	CODE
later	CODE
with	CODE
questions	CODE
but	CODE
i've	CODE
read	CODE
that	CODE
book	CODE
he	CODE
references	CODE
and	CODE
though	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
for	CODE
finding	CODE
optimal	CODE
solutions	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
impractical	CODE
in	CODE
use	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
requirements	CODE
edit	CODE
#2	CODE
i'll	CODE
definitely	CODE
hunt	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
xdelta	CODE
implementation	CODE
should	CODE
the	CODE
folders	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
match	CODE
the	CODE
namespace	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
teams	CODE
projects	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
library	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
many	CODE
sub-folders	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
project	CODE
project	CODE
name	CODE
and	CODE
namespace	CODE
mycompanyprojectsection	CODE
within	CODE
this	CODE
project	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
several	CODE
folders	CODE
that	CODE
match	CODE
the	CODE

few	CODE
cases	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
where	CODE
folders	CODE
are	CODE
made	CODE
for	CODE
organizational	CODE
convenience	CODE
my	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
what's	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
in	CODE
class	CODE
libraries	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
folders	CODE
usually	CODE
match	CODE
the	CODE
namespace	CODE
structure	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
mixed	CODE
bag	CODE
css	CODE
and	CODE
javascript	CODE
files	CODE
don't	CODE
change	CODE
very	CODE
often	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
cached	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
browser	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
browser	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
changes	CODE
made	CODE
to	CODE
these	CODE
files	CODE
without	CODE
requiring	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
to	CODE
clear	CODE
their	CODE
browser	CODE
cache	CODE
also	CODE
want	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
that	CODE
works	CODE
well	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
version	CODE
control	CODE
system	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
subversion	CODE
some	CODE
solutions	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
seen	CODE
involve	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
version	CODE
number	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
query	CODE
string	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
svn	CODE
revision	CODE
number	CODE
to	CODE
automate	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
aspnet	CODE
display	CODE
svn	CODE
revision	CODE
number	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
specify	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE
include	CODE
the	CODE
revision	CODE
variable	CODE
of	CODE
another	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
html	CODE
file	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
include	CODE
the	CODE
revision	CODE
number	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
url	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
css	CODE
or	CODE
javascript	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
subversion	CODE
book	CODE
it	CODE
says	CODE
about	CODE
revision	CODE
this	CODE
keyword	CODE
describes	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
known	CODE
revision	CODE
in	CODE
which	CODE
this	CODE
file	CODE
changed	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
repository	CODE
firefox	CODE
also	CODE
allows	CODE
pressing	CODE
ctrl+r	CODE
to	CODE
reload	CODE
everything	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
page	CODE
to	CODE
clarify	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
solutions	CODE
that	CODE
don't	CODE
require	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
anything	CODE
on	CODE
their	CODE
part	CODE
i'm	CODE
maintaining	CODE
a	CODE
net	CODE
11	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
things	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
tasked	CODE
with	CODE
is	CODE
making	CODE
sure	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
doesn't	CODE
see	CODE
any	CODE
unfriendly	CODE
error	CODE
notifications	CODE
i've	CODE
added	CODE
handlers	CODE
to	CODE
applicationthreadexception	CODE
and	CODE
appdomaincurrentdomainunhandledexception	CODE
which	CODE
do	CODE
get	CODE
called	CODE
my	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
clr	CODE
error	CODE
dialog	CODE
is	CODE
still	CODE
displayed	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
exception	CODE
handler	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
jeff	CODE
talks	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
problem	CODE
on	CODE
his	CODE
blog	CODE
here	CODE
and	CODE
here	CODE
but	CODE
there's	CODE
no	CODE
solution	CODE
so	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
way	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
11	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
uncaught	CODE
exceptions	CODE
and	CODE
display	CODE
a	CODE
friendly	CODE
dialog	CODE
box	CODE
edit	CODE
jeff's	CODE
response	CODE
was	CODE
marked	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
answer	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
link	CODE
he	CODE
provided	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
complete	CODE
information	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
what's	CODE
required	CODE
using	CODE
vs2008	CODE
c#	CODE
net	CODE
2	CODE
and	CODE
winforms	CODE
how	CODE
can	CODE
i	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
regular	CODE
button	CODE
look	CODE
pressed	CODE
imagine	CODE
this	CODE
button	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
onoff	CODE
switch	CODE
toolstripbutton	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
checked	CODE
property	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
regular	CODE
button	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
game	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
it	CODE
uses	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
as	CODE
back-end	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
trading	CODE
card	CODE
game	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
cards	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
script	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
essentially	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
interface	CODE
icard	CODE
which	CODE
a	CODE
card	CODE
class	CODE
implements	CODE
public	CODE
class	CODE
card056	CODE
icard	CODE
and	CODE
which	CODE
contains	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
called	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
game	CODE
now	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
thing	CODE
maintainablemoddable	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
card	CODE
as	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
and	CODE
essentially	CODE
compile	CODE
it	CODE
on	CODE
first	CODE
use	CODE
so	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
addchange	CODE
a	CODE
card	CODE
i'll	CODE
just	CODE
add	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
and	CODE
tell	CODE
my	CODE
application	CODE
to	CODE
refresh	CODE
without	CODE
needing	CODE
any	CODE
assembly	CODE
deployment	CODE
especially	CODE
since	CODE
we	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
1	CODE
assembly	CODE
per	CODE
card	CODE
which	CODE
means	CODE
hundreds	CODE
of	CODE
assemblies	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
possible	CODE
register	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
source	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
instantiate	CODE
it	CODE
etc	CODE
the	CODE
language	CODE
is	CODE
c#	CODE
but	CODE
extra	CODE
bonus	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
script	CODE
in	CODE
any	CODE
net	CODE
language	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
express	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
binary	CODE
number	CODE
with	CODE
python	CODE
literals	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
easily	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
for	CODE
hex	CODE

octal	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE

to	CODE
express	CODE

python	CODE
25	CODE

not	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE

0b1100111	CODE
python	CODE

believe	CODE
i'm	CODE
likely	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
and	CODE
more	CODE
informed	CODE
response	CODE
from	CODE
asking	CODE
a	CODE
question	CODE
here	CODE
-	CODE
suggestions	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
remember	CODE
whether	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
dreaming	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
recall	CODE
there	CODE
being	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
which	CODE
allowed	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
i've	CODE
looked	CODE
over	CODE
the	CODE
docs	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
thing	CODE
doesn't	CODE
fall	CODE
under	CODE
any	CODE
obvious	CODE
listed	CODE
headers	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
new	CODE
to	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
am	CODE
doing	CODE
some	CODE
work	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
application	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
directx	CODE
viewport	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
components	CODE
in	CODE
it	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
position	CODE
using	CODE
arrow	CODE
keys	CODE
currently	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
overriding	CODE
processcmdkey	CODE
and	CODE
catching	CODE
arrow	CODE
input	CODE
and	CODE
send	CODE
an	CODE
onkeypress	CODE
event	CODE
this	CODE
works	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
modifiersalt+ctrl+shift	CODE
as	CODE
soon	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
holding	CODE
a	CODE
modifier	CODE
and	CODE
press	CODE
an	CODE
arrow	CODE
no	CODE
events	CODE
are	CODE
triggered	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
listening	CODE
to	CODE
does	CODE
anyone	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
ideas	CODE
or	CODE
suggestions	CODE
on	CODE
where	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
no	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
think	CODE
about	CODE
it	CODE
that	CODE
information	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
worthless	CODE
anyway	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
could	CODE
become	CODE
locked	CODE
the	CODE
very	CODE
next	CODE
second	CODE
read	CODE
short	CODE
timespan	CODE
why	CODE
specifically	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
is	CODE
locked	CODE
anyway	CODE
knowing	CODE
that	CODE
might	CODE
give	CODE
us	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
giving	CODE
you	CODE
good	CODE
advice	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
would	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
then	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
lines	CODE
another	CODE
process	CODE
could	CODE
easily	CODE
lock	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
giving	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
problem	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
avoid	CODE
to	CODE
begin	CODE
with	CODE
exceptions	CODE
i've	CODE
worked	CODE
with	CODE
redgate's	CODE
profiler	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
did	CODE
the	CODE
job	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
jetbrains	CODE
dottrace	CODE
for	CODE
winforms	CODE
and	CODE
console	CODE
apps	CODE
not	CODE
tested	CODE
on	CODE
aspnet	CODE
yet	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
quite	CODE
well	CODE
they	CODE
recently	CODE
also	CODE
added	CODE
a	CODE
personal	CODE
license	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
significantly	CODE
cheaper	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
corporate	CODE
one	CODE
still	CODE
if	CODE
anyone	CODE
else	CODE
knows	CODE
some	CODE
cheaper	CODE
or	CODE
even	CODE
free	CODE
ones	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
hear	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
-	CODE
ants	CODE
profiler	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
used	CODE
many	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
really	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
complaints	CODE
about	CODE
ants	CODE
the	CODE
visualization	CODE
is	CODE
really	CODE
helpful	CODE
don't	CODE
forget	CODE
nprof	CODE
-	CODE
a	CODE
prefectly	CODE
good	CODE
freeware	CODE
profiler	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
asynchronously	CODE
using	CODE
net	CODE
ajax	CODE
pagemethods	CODE
see	CODE
here	CODE
or	CODE
here	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
ajax	CODE
library	CODE
will	CODE
accomplish	CODE
this	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
create	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
solution	CODE
that	CODE
involves	CODE
using	CODE
ajax	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
aspx	CODE
as	CODE
basically	CODE
script	CODE
files	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
net	CODE
functions	CODE
i	CODE
suggest	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
ajax	CODE
library	CODE
once	CODE
installed	CODE
and	CODE
referenced	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
line	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
page	CODE
load	CODE
or	CODE
init	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
page	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
parameter	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
function	CODE
call	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
callback	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
executed	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
ajax	CODE
request	CODE
is	CODE
returned	CODE
well	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
using	CODE
ajax	CODE
or	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
way	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
want	CODE
a	CODE
normal	CODE
aspnet	CODE
postback	CODE
to	CODE
happen	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
without	CODE
using	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
libraries	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
tricky	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
file	CODE
assuming	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
net	CODE
20	CODE
or	CODE
later	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
interface	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
page	CODE
class	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
ii	CODE
this	CODE
should	CODE
add	CODE
using	CODE
tab-tab	CODE
this	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
file	CODE
iii	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
onclick	CODE
event	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
code	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
'raisepostbackevent'	CODE
method	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
file	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
'eventargument'	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
'argumentstring'	CODE
you	CODE
passed	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
now	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
call	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
event	CODE
you	CODE
like	CODE
ps	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
'underscore-underscore-dopostback'	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
no	CODE
space	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
sequence	CODE
somehow	CODE
the	CODE
wmd	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
allow	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
to	CODE
underscores	CODE
followed	CODE
by	CODE
a	CODE
character	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
is	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
steal	CODE

and	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
certain	CODE
cases	CODE
where	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
fail	CODE
the	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
function	CODE
puts	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
that	CODE
created	CODE
the	CODE

into	CODE
the	CODE

activates	CODE

try	CODE
capturing	CODE
the	CODE

with	CODE
setcapture	CODE
prior	CODE
to	CODE
making	CODE
the	CODE
call	CODE
also	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
different	CODE
ways	CODE
of	CODE
bringing	CODE
the	CODE
window	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
front	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
setactivewindow	CODE
even	CODE
simulating	CODE
a	CODE
mouse	CODE
click	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
try	CODE
the	CODE
bringwindowtotop	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
not	CODE
steal	CODE
focus	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
used	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
setactivewindow	CODE
and	CODE
bringwindowtotop	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
as	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
all	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
according	CODE
to	CODE
msdn	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
will	CODE
activate	CODE
the	CODE
window	CODE
and	CODE
direct	CODE
keyboard	CODE
focus	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
attempts	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
even	CODE
when	CODE
your	CODE
process	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
background	CODE
setactivewindow	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
as	CODE
setforegroundwindow	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
do	CODE
anything	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
isn't	CODE
the	CODE
frontmost	CODE
application	CODE
finally	CODE
bringwindowtotop	CODE
only	CODE
brings	CODE
the	CODE
window	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
and	CODE
doesn't	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
keyboard	CODE
focus	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
aspnet	CODE
20	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
with	CODE
cross-page	CODE
posting	CODE
edit	CODE
i	CODE
missed	CODE
the	CODE
fact	CODE
that	CODE
you're	CODE
asking	CODE
about	CODE
an	CODE
external	CODE
page	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you'd	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
your	CODE
aspnet	CODE
page	CODE
gen	CODE
up	CODE
an	CODE
html	CODE
form	CODE
whose	CODE
action	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
remote	CODE
url	CODE
and	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
post	CODE
using	CODE
cross-page	CODE
posting	CODE
this	CODE
could	CODE
even	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
page	CODE
with	CODE
no	CODE
ui	CODE
only	CODE
hidden	CODE
form	CODE
elements	CODE
then	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
javascript	CODE
to	CODE
submit	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
as	CODE
soon	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
postback	CODE
result	CODE
was	CODE
received	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
done	CODE
this	CODE
by	CODE
rendering	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
that	CODE
auto-posts	CODE
using	CODE
javascript	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
desired	CODE
remote	CODE
url	CODE
-	CODE
gather	CODE
whatever	CODE
information	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
post	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
form's	CODE
postback	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
build	CODE
the	CODE
html	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
remote-posting	CODE
form	CODE
and	CODE
render	CODE
it	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
i	CODE
built	CODE
a	CODE
utility	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
that	CODE
contains	CODE
the	CODE
remote	CODE
url	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
namevalue	CODE
pairs	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
cross-page	CODE
posting	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
own	CODE
both	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
pages	CODE
involved	CODE
but	CODE
not	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
post	CODE
to	CODE
another	CODE
site	CODE
paypal	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
here's	CODE
i	CODE
solved	CODE
this	CODE
problem	CODE
today	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
from	CODE
this	CODE
article	CODE
on	CODE
c#	CODE
corner	CODE
but	CODE
found	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
-	CODE
while	CODE
technically	CODE
sound	CODE
-	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
incomplete	CODE
everything	CODE
he	CODE
said	CODE
was	CODE
right	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
needed	CODE
to	CODE
hit	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
external	CODE
sites	CODE
to	CODE
piece	CODE
this	CODE
together	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
exactly	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
it	CODE
didn't	CODE
help	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
was	CODE
not	CODE
technically	CODE
submitting	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
they	CODE
were	CODE
clicking	CODE
a	CODE
link	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
to	CODE
our	CODE
support	CODE
center	CODE
but	CODE
to	CODE
log	CODE
them	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
http	CODE
post	CODE
had	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
made	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
support	CODE
center's	CODE
site	CODE
this	CODE
solution	CODE
involves	CODE
using	CODE
httpcontextcurrentresponsewrite	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
then	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
javascript	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
submit	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
proper	CODE
url	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
clicks	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
support	CODE
center	CODE
link	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
response	CODE
and	CODE
redirect	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
onload	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
javascript	CODE
which	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
body	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
loads	CODE
submits	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
redirects	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
home	CODE
page	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
hoodoo	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
i'm	CODE
launching	CODE
the	CODE
external	CODE
site	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
window	CODE
but	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
to	CODE
resubmit	CODE
the	CODE
hidden	CODE
form	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
refresh	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
plus	CODE
that	CODE
hidden	CODE
form	CODE
pushed	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
down	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
pixels	CODE
which	CODE
got	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
nerves	CODE
i'd	CODE
be	CODE
very	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
any	CODE
cleaner	CODE
ideas	CODE
anyone	CODE
has	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
one	CODE
eric	CODE
sipple	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
post	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
behind	CODE
using	CODE
httpwebrequest	CODE
class	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
helper	CODE
class	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
your	CODE
started	CODE
from	CODE
there	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
responseredirect	CODE
or	CODE
perhaps	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
vary	CODE
your	CODE
action	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
outcome	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
post	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
an	CODE
error	CODE
display	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
or	CODE
whatever	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
already	CODE
had	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
question	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
honest	CODE
-	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
post	CODE
or	CODE
redirect	CODE
when	CODE
in	CODE
reality	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
them	CODE
both	CODE
from	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
behind	CODE
well	CODE
ie	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
somewhat	CODE
non-standard	CODE
object	CODE
model	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
doing	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
work	CODE
but	CODE
you're	CODE
getting	CODE
away	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
because	CODE
ie	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
nice	CODE
to	CODE
you	CODE
in	CODE
firefox	CODE
and	CODE
safari	CODE
documentfrm	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
evaluates	CODE
to	CODE
undefined	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
using	CODE
id	CODE
values	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
form	CODE
elements	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
documentgetelementbyid'whatever'	CODE
to	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE
reference	CODE
to	CODE
them	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
referring	CODE
to	CODE
non-existent	CODE
properties	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
document	CODE
object	CODE
so	CODE
this	CODE
works	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
better	CODE
and	CODE
may	CODE
do	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
after	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
this	CODE
excellent	CODE
book	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
more	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
going	CODE
about	CODE
things	CODE
dom	CODE
scripting	CODE
by	CODE
jeremy	CODE
keith	CODE
also	CODE
while	CODE
we're	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
subject	CODE
bulletproof	CODE
ajax	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
author	CODE
is	CODE
also	CODE
deserving	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
place	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
bookshelf	CODE
as	CODE
is	CODE
javascript	CODE
the	CODE
good	CODE
parts	CODE
by	CODE
doug	CODE
crockford	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
grab	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
ajax	CODE
scripting	CODE
libraries	CODE
they	CODE
abstract	CODE
away	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
cross	CODE
browser	CODE
dom	CODE
scripting	CODE
black	CODE
magic	CODE
and	CODE
make	CODE
life	CODE
a	CODE
hell	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
easier	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
experience	CODE
with	CODE
httpwwwsitegroundcom	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
host	CODE
personally	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
guess	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
common	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
shared	CODE
host	CODE
to	CODE
support	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
mysql	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
mysqldb	CODE
module	CODE
eg	CODE
godaddy	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
try	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
cgi	CODE
script	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
mysqldb	CODE
is	CODE
installed	CODE
i	CODE
uploaded	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
got	CODE
an	CODE
internal	CODE
error	CODE
after	CODE
much	CODE
playing	CODE
around	CODE
i	CODE
found	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
give	CODE
me	CODE
a	CODE
much	CODE
more	CODE
useful	CODE
answer	CODE
and	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
not	CODE
installed	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
see	CODE
it	CODE
yourself	CODE
->	CODE
httpwoarlcomdbpy	CODE
oddly	CODE
enough	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
produce	CODE
an	CODE
error	CODE
i	CODE
looked	CODE
at	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
files	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
up	CODE
there	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
that	CODE
library	CODE
was	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
ones	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
already	CODE
tried	CODE
mysqldb	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
used	CODE
before	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
host	CODE
is	CODE
using	CODE
python	CODE
version	CODE
25	CODE
or	CODE
higher	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE
sqlite3	CODE
databases	CODE
is	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
sqlite	CODE
allows	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
relational	CODE
database	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
simply	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
filesystem	CODE
but	CODE
buyer	CODE
beware	CODE
sqlite	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
suited	CODE
for	CODE
production	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
may	CODE
depend	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
another	CODE
option	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
your	CODE
host	CODE
and	CODE
complain	CODE
or	CODE
change	CODE
hosts	CODE
honestly	CODE
these	CODE
days	CODE
any	CODE
self	CODE
respecting	CODE
web	CODE
host	CODE
that	CODE
supports	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
mysql	CODE
ought	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
mysqldb	CODE
pre	CODE
installed	CODE
i	CODE
really	CODE
like	CODE
regular	CODE
expressions	CODE
as	CODE
long	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
strings	CODE
are	CODE
fairly	CODE
simple	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
regexes	CODE
that	CODE
could	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
pages	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
manually	CODE
parse	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
suggest	CODE
you	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
httpwwwregular-expressionsinfo	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
intro	CODE
to	CODE
regexes	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
specific	CODE
examples	CODE
for	CODE
java	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
string	CODE
tokenizer	CODE
on	CODE
spaces	CODE
should	CODE
work	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
really	CODE
many	CODE
ways	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
tokenizer	CODE
then	CODE
tokens	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
further	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
arguments	CODE
this	CODE
all	CODE
assumes	CODE
no	CODE
spaces	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
arguments	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
roll	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
simple	CODE
parsing	CODE
mechanism	CODE
like	CODE
getting	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
whitespace	CODE
and	CODE
using	CODE
text	CODE
before	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
action	CODE
or	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
regular	CODE
expression	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
mind	CODE
the	CODE
speed	CODE
hit	CODE
just	CODE
abstract	CODE
it	CODE
out	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
anywhere	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
java	CODE
migrations	CODE
of	CODE
zork	CODE

lean	CODE
towards	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE

possible	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
i	CODE
suggest	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
algorithm	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
read	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
split	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
into	CODE
tokens	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
synonyms	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
common	CODE
form	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
convert	CODE
hit	CODE
punch	CODE
strike	CODE

kick	CODE
all	CODE
to	CODE
hit	CODE
perform	CODE
actions	CODE
on	CODE
an	CODE
unordered	CODE

base	CODE
unordered	CODE
-	CODE
punch	CODE
the	CODE
monkey	CODE

is	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
face	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
monkey	CODE
punch	CODE
inclusive	CODE
-	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
is	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
punch	CODE
the	CODE
monkey	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
face	CODE
and	CODE
they	CODE
supply	CODE
punch	CODE
monkey	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
check	CODE
how	CODE
many	CODE
commands	CODE
this	CODE
matches	CODE
if	CODE
only	CODE
one	CODE
command	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
action	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
even	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
idea	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
command	CODE
priorities	CODE
and	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
were	CODE
even	CODE

it	CODE
would	CODE
perform	CODE

clean	CODE
up	CODE

allways	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE

like	CODE
the	CODE
y	CODE
recomend	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
strinktokenizer	CODE
class	CODE
stringtokenizer	CODE
but	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE

varies	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
complex	CODE
y	CODE
recomend	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE

can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE

recommends	CODE
staying	CODE
away	CODE
from	CODE

using	CODE
the	CODE

you'll	CODE
also	CODE
want	CODE

no	CODE
more	CODE
snarky	CODE
comments	CODE
how	CODE
do	CODE
i	CODE
figure	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE

should	CODE
be	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE

ok	CODE
ok	CODE
seriously	CODE
last	CODE
one	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE

you	CODE

you	CODE
have	CODE
two	CODE
choices	CODE
start	CODE
guessing	CODE

possibly	CODE
bust	CODE
out	CODE
an	CODE

if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
starting	CODE
point	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
suggest	CODE
9600-8-n-1	CODE
my	CODE
suspicion	CODE
is	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
there	CODE
with	CODE
brute	CODE
force	CODE
relatively	CODE
quickly	CODE
there's	CODE
a	CODE
third	CODE
option	CODE
of	CODE
having	CODE
an	CODE
old-school	CODE
ninja	CODE
who	CODE
can	CODE
tell	CODE
just	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
look	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
garbled	CODE
characters	CODE
at	CODE
some	CODE
standard	CODE
baud	CODE
rate	CODE
what	CODE
actual	CODE
baud	CODE
rate	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
impressive	CODE
party	CODE
trick	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
sure	CODE
hopefully	CODE
though	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
information	CODE
in	CODE
unixlinux	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
ahold	CODE
of	CODE
minicom	CODE
to	CODE
play	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
directly	CODE
this	CODE
should	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
fairly	CODE
quick	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
configuration	CODE
figured	CODE
out	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
major	CODE
unix	CODE

in	CODE
unix	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
ports	CODE
isare	CODE
file-mapped	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
dev	CODE
subdir	CODE
ttys0	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
setup	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
baud	CODE
rate	CODE
and	CODE
whatnot	CODE
using	CODE
minicom	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
even	CODE
cat	CODE
stuff	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
file	CODE
to	CODE
send	CODE
stuff	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
meat	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
access	CODE
it	CODE
programmatically	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
posix	CODE
headers	CODE
termiosh	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
big	CODE
one	CODE
see	CODE
httpwwweasyswcom~mikeserialserialhtml#3_1	CODE
not	CODE
available	CODE
anymore	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
interest	CODE
in	CODE
serial	CODE
programming	CODE
using	CODE
windowshyperterminal	CODE
hyperterminal	CODE
and	CODE
minicom	CODE
are	CODE
basically	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
program	CODE
as	CODE
for	CODE
how	CODE
windows	CODE
let's	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
i'll	CODE
leave	CODE
that	CODE
question	CODE
for	CODE
someone	CODE
else	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
done	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
windows	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
win95	CODE
days	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
side	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
using	CODE
c#	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
run	CODE
on	CODE
both	CODE
windows	CODE
and	CODE
linux--with	CODE
some	CODE
limitations	CODE
edit	CODE
which	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
date	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
test	CODE
it	CODE
just	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
serialport	CODE
object	CODE
set	CODE
its	CODE
baudrate	CODE
port	CODE
and	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
odd	CODE
settings	CODE
call	CODE
open	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
write	CODE
out	CODE
your	CODE
byte[]s	CODE
after	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
setup	CODE
the	CODE
serialport	CODE
object	CODE
acts	CODE
very	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
any	CODE
networked	CODE
stream	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
easy	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
figure	CODE
out	CODE
and	CODE
as	CODE
ibrandy	CODE
states	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
all	CODE
these	CODE
settings	CODE
like	CODE
baud	CODE
rate	CODE
before	CODE
you	CODE
even	CODE
start	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
communicate	CODE
to	CODE
any	CODE
serial	CODE
device	CODE
at	CODE
work	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
teraterm	CODE
and	CODE
realterm	CODE
for	CODE
checking	CODE
serial	CODE
data	CODE
is	CODE
correctly	CODE
formatted	CODE
also	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
hardware	CODE
splitter	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
switch	CODE
so	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
monitor	CODE
traffic	CODE
to	CODE
our	CODE
application	CODE
via	CODE
a	CODE
cable	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
another	CODE
port	CODE
windows	CODE
allows	CODE
you	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
via	CODE
createfile	CODE
that	CODE
gives	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
handle	CODE
and	CODE
from	CODE
there	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
configure	CODE
access	CODE
from	CODE
java	CODE
the	CODE

off	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
two	CODE
main	CODE
ways	CODE
of	CODE
running	CODE
python	CODE
on	CODE

the	CODE
simplest	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
cgi	CODE
and	CODE
write	CODE
normal	CODE
python	CODE
scripts	CODE
while	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
is	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
framework	CODE
like	CODE
django	CODE
or	CODE
pylons	CODE
using	CODE
cgi	CODE
is	CODE
straightforward	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
your	CODE
apache	CODE
config	CODE
file	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
cgi-bin	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
follow	CODE
their	CODE
documentation	CODE
httphttpdapacheorgdocs20howtocgihtml	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
all	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
place	CODE
your	CODE
python	CODE
scripts	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
cgi-bin	CODE
directory	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
output	CODE

refer	CODE

further	CODE
info	CODE
httpsdocspythonorglibrarycgihtml	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
framework	CODE
you'll	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
setup	CODE
mod_python	CODE
or	CODE
fastcgi	CODE
these	CODE
steps	CODE
are	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
which	CODE
framework	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
django	CODE
provides	CODE
clear	CODE
instructions	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
setup	CODE
mod_python	CODE
and	CODE
django	CODE
with	CODE
apache	CODE
httpwwwdjangoprojectcomdocumentationmodpython	CODE
yes	CODE
mod_python	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
confusing	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
here's	CODE
how	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
httpdconf	CODE
and	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
directory	CODE
repeat	CODE
the	CODE
configuration	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
python	CODE
program	CODE
you	CODE
wish	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
running	CODE
under	CODE
mod_python	CODE
are	CODE
you	CODE
running	CODE
python	CODE
on	CODE
unix	CODE
or	CODE
windows	CODE
an	CODE
alternative	CODE
to	CODE
mod_python	CODE

fastcgi	CODE
is	CODE
mod_wsgi	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
out	CODE
more	CODE
at	CODE
modwsgi	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
built	CODE
and	CODE
installed	CODE
this	CODE
on	CODE
solaris	CODE
without	CODE
problems	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
previously	CODE
tried	CODE
mod_python	CODE
but	CODE
ran	CODE
into	CODE
problems	CODE
with	CODE
shared	CODE
libraries	CODE
as	CODE
part	CODE

the	CODE

there	CODE
are	CODE
good	CODE

httpasmobjectweborg	CODE
is	CODE
another	CODE
one	CODE
excellent	CODE
documentation	CODE
on	CODE

code	CODE
instrumentation	CODE
but	CODE
nothing	CODE
directly	CODE
aimed	CODE
at	CODE
writing	CODE
a	CODE
coverage	CODE
tool	CODE
-	CODE
just	CODE
some	CODE
hints	CODE
or	CODE
ideas	CODE
absolutely	CODE
when	CODE
nobody	CODE
knows	CODE
the	CODE
low	CODE
level	CODE
who	CODE
will	CODE
update	CODE
and	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
high	CODE
level	CODE
languages	CODE
also	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
understand	CODE
the	CODE
low	CODE
level	CODE
stuff	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
more	CODE
efficient	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
higher	CODE

and	CODE
also	CODE
debug	CODE
more	CODE
efficiently	CODE
learning	CODE
c	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
lower	CODE
level	CODE
language	CODE
can	CODE
definitely	CODE
be	CODE
useful	CODE
however	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
see	CODE
any	CODE
obvious	CODE
advantage	CODE
in	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
unmanaged	CODE
winapi	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
low	CODE

windows	CODE
api	CODE
code	CODE
it	CODE
ain't	CODE
pretty	CODE
i	CODE
wish	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
unlearn	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
benefits	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
low	CODE

as	CODE
in	CODE
c	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
gain	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
understanding	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
hardware	CODE
architecture	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
stuff	CODE
works	CODE
learning	CODE
old	CODE
windows	CODE
api	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
stuff	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
left	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
people	CODE
at	CODE
microsoft	CODE
who	CODE
may	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
higher	CODE
level	CODE
languages	CODE
and	CODE
api	CODE
they	CODE
built	CODE
it	CODE
let	CODE
them	CODE
suffer	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
-	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
happen	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
situation	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
feel	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
can't	CODE
do	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
higher	CODE
level	CODE
language	CODE
few	CODE
and	CODE
far	CODE
between	CODE
then	CODE
perhaps	CODE
start	CODE
the	CODE
dangerous	CODE
dive	CODE
into	CODE
that	CODE
world	CODE
the	CODE
native	CODE

are	CODE
the	CODE
real	CODE

system	CODE
apis	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
library	CODE
is	CODE
with	CODE
few	CODE
exceptions	CODE
nothing	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
a	CODE
fancy	CODE
wrapper	CODE
around	CODE
them	CODE
so	CODE
yes	CODE
i'd	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
anybody	CODE
who	CODE
can	CODE
understand	CODE
net	CODE
with	CODE
all	CODE
its	CODE
complexity	CODE
can	CODE
understand	CODE
relatively	CODE
mundane	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
talking	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
benefit	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
middle-man	CODE
just	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
dll	CODE
injection	CODE
from	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
it	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
forced	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
native	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
windowing	CODE
tweaks	CODE
for	CODE
real	CODE
subclassing	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
dozen	CODE
other	CODE
things	CODE
so	CODE
yes	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
must	CODE
know	CODE
both	CODE
edit	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
plan	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
pinvoke	CODE
this	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
bordering	CODE
on	CODE
religious	CODE
but	CODE
i'll	CODE
give	CODE
my	CODE
thoughts	CODE
anyway	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
see	CODE
value	CODE
in	CODE
learing	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
most	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
all	CODE
gui	CODE
libraries	CODE
managed	CODE
or	CODE
unmanaged	CODE
result	CODE
in	CODE
calls	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
even	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
thorough	CODE
libraries	CODE
don't	CODE
cover	CODE
100%	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
and	CODE
hence	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
always	CODE
gaps	CODE
which	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
plugged	CODE
by	CODE
direct	CODE
api	CODE
calls	CODE
or	CODE
pinvoking	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
names	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
wrappers	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
calls	CODE
have	CODE
similar	CODE
names	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
underlying	CODE
api	CODE
calls	CODE
but	CODE
those	CODE
names	CODE
aren't	CODE
exactly	CODE
self-documenting	CODE
so	CODE
understanding	CODE
the	CODE
underlying	CODE
api	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
terminology	CODE
used	CODE
therein	CODE
will	CODE
aid	CODE
in	CODE
understanding	CODE
the	CODE
wrapper	CODE
apis	CODE
and	CODE
what	CODE
they	CODE
actually	CODE
do	CODE
plus	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
understand	CODE
the	CODE
nature	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
underlying	CODE
apis	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
by	CODE
frameworks	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
make	CODE
better	CODE
choices	CODE
with	CODE
regards	CODE
to	CODE
which	CODE
library	CODE
functionality	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
scenario	CODE
cheers	CODE
analogy	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
build	CODE
cars	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
living	CODE
programming	CODE
then	CODE
its	CODE
very	CODE
pertinent	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
the	CODE
engine	CODE
works	CODE
win32	CODE
simple	CODE
answer	CODE
yes	CODE
learning	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
programming	CODE
language	CODE
or	CODE
technology	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
three	CODE
reasons	CODE
1	CODE
need	CODE
you're	CODE
starting	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
for	CODE
building	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
anything	CODE
about	CODE
aspnet	CODE
2	CODE
enthusiasm	CODE
you're	CODE
very	CODE
excited	CODE
about	CODE
aspnet	CODE
mvc	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
try	CODE
that	CODE
3	CODE
free	CODE
time	CODE
but	CODE
who	CODE
has	CODE
that	CODE
anyway	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
reason	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
something	CODE
new	CODE
is	CODE
need	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
framework	CODE
can't	CODE
do	CODE
like	CODE
performance	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
then	CODE
winapi	CODE
is	CODE
your	CODE
solution	CODE
until	CODE
then	CODE
we	CODE
keep	CODE
ourself	CODE
busy	CODE
with	CODE
learning	CODE
about	CODE
net	CODE
it's	CODE
important	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
available	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
windows	CODE
api	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
crank	CODE
out	CODE
code	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
framework	CODE
contains	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
functionality	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
provide	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
equivalents	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
entire	CODE
windows	CODE
api	CODE
sometimes	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
closer	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
metal	CODE
and	CODE
knowing	CODE
what's	CODE
down	CODE
there	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
behaves	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
understanding	CODE
of	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
for	CODE
most	CODE
needs	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
desktop	CODE
you	CODE
wont	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
however	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
win32	CODE
not	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
outlaying	CODE
stuff	CODE
that	CODE
may	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
being	CODE
less	CODE
than	CODE
1%	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
usb	CODE
support	CODE
hid	CODE
support	CODE
windows	CODE
media	CODE
foundation	CODE
just	CODE
off	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
head	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
many	CODE
cool	CODE
vista	CODE
api's	CODE
only	CODE
available	CODE
from	CODE
win32	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
do	CODE
yourself	CODE
a	CODE
large	CODE
favor	CODE
by	CODE
learning	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
interop	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
desktop	CODE
programing	CODE
because	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
win32	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
you	CODE
won't	CODE
spend	CODE
weeks	CODE
scratching	CODE
your	CODE
head	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
always	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
recommend	CODE
it	CODE
there's	CODE
no	CODE
guarantee	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
inserted	CODE
key	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
array	CODE
the	CODE
ordering	CODE
for	CODE
keys	CODE
on	CODE
msdn	CODE
is	CODE
unspecified	CODE
and	CODE
subject	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
very	CODE
brief	CODE
test	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
insertion	CODE
but	CODE
you'd	CODE
be	CODE
better	CODE
off	CODE
building	CODE
in	CODE
proper	CODE
bookkeeping	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
stack--as	CODE
you	CODE
suggest	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
need	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
struct	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
other	CODE
statements--or	CODE
single	CODE
variable	CODE
cache	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
latest	CODE
key	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
work	CODE
because	CODE
i'm	CODE
pretty	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
keys	CODE
aren't	CODE
stored	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
added	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
cast	CODE
the	CODE
keyscollection	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
key	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
worth	CODE
having	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
other	CODE
thing	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
keys	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
lookup	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
keys	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
before	CODE
you	CODE
add	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
pretty	CODE
tho	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
syntax	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
wrong	CODE
havent	CODE
used	CODE
c#	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
while	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
item	CODE
or	CODE
use	CODE
max	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
last	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
max	CODE
value	CODE
i	CODE
dont	CODE
know	CODE
which	CODE
one	CODE
fits	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
better	CODE
i	CODE
agree	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
patrick's	CODE
answer	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
tests	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
keep	CODE
insertion	CODE
order	CODE
the	CODE
documentation	CODE
and	CODE
normal	CODE
behavior	CODE
for	CODE
dictionaries	CODE
and	CODE
hashes	CODE
explicitly	CODE
states	CODE
the	CODE
ordering	CODE
is	CODE
unspecified	CODE
you're	CODE
just	CODE
asking	CODE
for	CODE
trouble	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
ordering	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
keys	CODE
add	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
bookkeeping	CODE
as	CODE
patrick	CODE
said	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
variable	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
added	CODE
key	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
sure	CODE
also	CODE
don't	CODE
be	CODE
tempted	CODE
by	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
methods	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
last	CODE
and	CODE
max	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
as	CODE
those	CODE
are	CODE
probably	CODE
in	CODE
relation	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
comparator	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
about	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
worded	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
leads	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
believe	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
int	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
contains	CODE
the	CODE
item's	CODE
position	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
judging	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
assertion	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
keys	CODE
aren't	CODE
stored	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
that	CODE
they're	CODE
added	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
correct	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
mean	CODE
that	CODE
keyscount	CODE
or	CODE
count	CODE
-	CODE
1	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
zero-based	CODE
should	CODE
still	CODE
always	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
last-entered	CODE
key	CODE
if	CODE
that's	CODE
correct	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
any	CODE
reason	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
instead	CODE
use	CODE
dictionaryint	CODE
string	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
mydict[	CODE
mydictkeyscount	CODE
]	CODE
why	CODE
don't	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
extend	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
class	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
last	CODE
key	CODE
inserted	CODE
property	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
maybe	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
ordereddictionary	CODE
represents	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
keyvalue	CODE
pairs	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
accessible	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
or	CODE
index	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
paging	CODE
repeater	CODE
or	CODE
gridview	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
linqdatasource	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
automatically	CODE
optimize	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
results	CODE
returned	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
also	CODE
pretty	CODE
sure	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
datasource	CODE
wizard	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
go	CODE
to	CODE
advanced	CODE
options	CODE
and	CODE
limit	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
which	CODE
should	CODE
allow	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
for	CODE
c++	CODE

about	CODE

on	CODE
my	CODE
computer	CODE
for	CODE
multiple	CODE

the	CODE
easiest	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
index	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
index	CODE
strings	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
2355	CODE

344556	CODE
3	CODE
vars	CODE
hash	CODE
tables	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
fast	CODE
insertion	CODE
and	CODE
look	CODE
up	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
hash	CODE
function	CODE
since	CODE
you	CODE
know	CODE
you'd	CODE
be	CODE
dealing	CODE
with	CODE
only	CODE

the	CODE

the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE

atleast	CODE

the	CODE
complicating	CODE

if	CODE
it	CODE

the	CODE

thing	CODE
matters	CODE
very	CODE
very	CODE
much	CODE
if	CODE
a	CODE
header	CODE
file	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
then	CODE
unless	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
c++-only	CODE
header	CODE
file	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
enclose	CODE
your	CODE
#include	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
basically	CODE
anytime	CODE
where	CODE
a	CODE
c++	CODE
program	CODE
wants	CODE
to	CODE
link	CODE
to	CODE
c-based	CODE
facilities	CODE
the	CODE
extern	CODE
c	CODE
is	CODE
vital	CODE
in	CODE
practical	CODE
terms	CODE
it	CODE
means	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
names	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
external	CODE
references	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
mangled	CODE
like	CODE
normal	CODE
c++	CODE
names	CODE
would	CODE
reference	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
mouse	CODE
click	CODE
event	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
treeview	CODE
then	CODE
select	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
node	CODE
using	CODE
getnodeat	CODE
given	CODE
the	CODE
mouse	CODE
coordinates	CODE
provided	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
mouseeventargs	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
menu	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
selected	CODE
item	CODE
you're	CODE
best	CODE
move	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
jonesinator's	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
select	CODE
the	CODE
clicked	CODE
item	CODE
your	CODE
context	CODE
menu	CODE
content	CODE
can	CODE
then	CODE
be	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
selected	CODE
item	CODE
selecting	CODE
the	CODE
item	CODE
first	CODE
as	CODE
opposed	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
menu	CODE
gives	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
advantages	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
visual	CODE
indication	CODE
as	CODE
to	CODE
which	CODE
he	CODE
clicked	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
which	CODE
item	CODE
the	CODE
menu	CODE
is	CODE
associated	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
hell	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
keep	CODE
compatible	CODE
with	CODE
other	CODE
methods	CODE
of	CODE
invoking	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
menu	CODE
eg	CODE
keyboard	CODE
shortcuts	CODE
for	CODE
c#	CODE
35	CODE
without	CODE
notifyicon	CODE
therefore	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
terminate	CODE
this	CODE
application	CODE
in	CODE
task	CODE
manager	CODE
manually	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
should	CODE
work	CODE
though	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
interval	CODE
boy	CODE
that's	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
general	CODE
question	CODE
i'll	CODE
do	CODE
my	CODE
best	CODE
but	CODE
be	CODE
prepared	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
me	CODE
miss	CODE
by	CODE
a	CODE
mile	CODE
assumptions	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
aspnet	CODE
not	CODE
plain	CODE
asp	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
really	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
test	CODE
your	CODE
web	CODE
pages	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
behind	CODE
them	CODE
unit	CODE
testing	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
aspx	CODE
pages	CODE
is	CODE
rather	CODE
painful	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
frameworks	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
nunitasp	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
thing	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
organize	CODE
or	CODE
plan	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
tested	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
most	CODE
popular	CODE
design	CODE
patterns	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
mvp	CODE
and	CODE
mvc	CODE
both	CODE
separate	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
away	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
view	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
test	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
view	CODE
web	CODE
pages	CODE
getting	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
way	CODE
either	CODE
mvp	CODE
or	CODE
mvc	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
effective	CODE
mvc	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
advantage	CODE
of	CODE
having	CODE
a	CODE
microsoft	CODE
framework	CODE
almost	CODE
ready	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
once	CODE
you've	CODE
selected	CODE
a	CODE
framework	CODE

[edit]	CODE
my	CODE
original	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
certainly	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
pronounced	CODE
difference	CODE
but	CODE
as	CODE
eric	CODE
lippert	CODE
points	CODE
out	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
one	CODE
other	CODE
differences	CODE
include	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
'as'	CODE
operator	CODE
to	CODE
cast	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
type	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
accept	CODE
'null'	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
value	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
use	CODE
'as'	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
numbers	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
representation	CODE
float	CODE
to	CODE
int	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
and	CODE
finally	CODE
using	CODE
'as'	CODE
vs	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
operator	CODE
you're	CODE
also	CODE
saying	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
succeed	CODE
the	CODE
parenthetical	CODE
cast	CODE
throws	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
attempt	CODE
fails	CODE
the	CODE
as	CODE
cast	CODE
returns	CODE
null	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
attempt	CODE
fails	CODE
they'll	CODE
throw	CODE
different	CODE
exceptions	CODE
nullreferenceexception	CODE
as	CODE
invalidcastexception	CODE
which	CODE
could	CODE
help	CODE
for	CODE
debugging	CODE
the	CODE
as	CODE
keyword	CODE
attempts	CODE
to	CODE
cast	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
fails	CODE
null	CODE
is	CODE
returned	CODE
silently	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
operator	CODE
will	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
immediately	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
fails	CODE
only	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
c#	CODE
as	CODE
keyword	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
expecting	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
to	CODE
fail	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
non-exceptional	CODE
case	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
counting	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
cast	CODE
to	CODE
succeed	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
unprepared	CODE
to	CODE
receive	CODE
any	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
fail	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
operator	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
an	CODE
appropriate	CODE
and	CODE
helpful	CODE
exception	CODE
is	CODE
thrown	CODE
for	CODE
code	CODE
examples	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
further	CODE
explanation	CODE
httpblognerdbanknet200806when-not-to-use-c-keywordhtml	CODE
also	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
only	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
as	CODE
keyword	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
reference	CODE
type	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
nullable	CODE
type	CODE
ie	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
compile	CODE
will	CODE
compile	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
remember	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
that	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
follow	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
when	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
decide	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
for	CODE
my	CODE
circumstance	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
guess	CODE
what	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
case	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
cast	CODE
than	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
is	CODE
thrown	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
case	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
cast	CODE
i	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
null	CODE
so	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
case	CODE
a	CODE
hard	CODE
stop	CODE
is	CODE
made	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
cast	CODE
fails	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
cast	CODE
a	CODE
soft	CODE
stop	CODE
is	CODE
made	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
encounter	CODE
a	CODE
nullreferenceexception	CODE
later	CODE
on	CODE
it's	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
parse	CODE
and	CODE
tryparse	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
tryparse	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
expect	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
fail	CODE
but	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
strong	CODE
assurance	CODE
it	CODE
won't	CODE
fail	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
parse	CODE
looking	CODE
around	CODE
and	CODE
using	CODE
some	CODE
c#	CODE
30	CODE
features	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
cleanest	CODE
way	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
ruby	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
handling	CODE
hashes	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
high	CODE
level	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
other	CODE
choice	CODE
then	CODE
to	CODE
walk	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE
dictionary	CODE
and	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
each	CODE
value	CODE
maybe	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE
copypasting	CODE
from	CODE
john	CODE
timney	CODE
since	CODE
you're	CODE
targeting	CODE
net	CODE
20	CODE
or	CODE
above	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
simplify	CODE
this	CODE
into	CODE
lambda	CODE
syntax	CODE
--	CODE
it's	CODE
equivalent	CODE
but	CODE
shorter	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
targeting	CODE
net	CODE
20	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
only	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
syntax	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
from	CODE
vs2008	CODE
or	CODE
above	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
linq	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
allow	CODE
for	CODE
great	CODE
flexibility	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
select	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
10	CODE
20	CODE
10%	CODE
etc	CODE
or	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
your	CODE
word	CODE
frequency	CODE
index	CODE
for	CODE
type-ahead	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
include	CODE
startswith	CODE
clause	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
not	CODE
all	CODE
languages	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
concept	CODE
of	CODE
unsigned	CODE
ints	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
vb	CODE
6	CODE
had	CODE
no	CODE
concept	CODE
of	CODE
unsigned	CODE
ints	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
suspect	CODE
drove	CODE
the	CODE
decision	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
designers	CODE
of	CODE
vb771	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
it's	CODE
implemented	CODE
now	CODE
in	CODE
vb8	CODE
to	CODE
quote	CODE
httpmsdnmicrosoftcomen-uslibrary12a7a7h3aspx	CODE
the	CODE
cls	CODE
was	CODE
designed	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
large	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
include	CODE
the	CODE
language	CODE
constructs	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
commonly	CODE
needed	CODE
by	CODE
developers	CODE
yet	CODE
small	CODE
enough	CODE
that	CODE
most	CODE
languages	CODE
are	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
support	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
addition	CODE
any	CODE
language	CODE
construct	CODE
that	CODE
makes	CODE
it	CODE
impossible	CODE
to	CODE
rapidly	CODE
verify	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
safety	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
was	CODE
excluded	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
cls	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
all	CODE
cls-compliant	CODE
languages	CODE
can	CODE
produce	CODE
verifiable	CODE
code	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
choose	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
so	CODE
update	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
wonder	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
some	CODE
years	CODE
back	CODE
and	CODE
whilst	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
see	CODE
why	CODE
a	CODE
uint	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
be	CODE
type	CODE
safety	CODE
verifiable	CODE
i	CODE
guess	CODE
the	CODE
cls	CODE
guys	CODE
had	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
cut	CODE
off	CODE
point	CODE
somewhere	CODE
as	CODE
to	CODE
what	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
baseline	CODE
minimum	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
value	CODE
types	CODE
supported	CODE
also	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
think	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
longer	CODE
term	CODE
where	CODE
more	CODE
and	CODE
more	CODE
languages	CODE
are	CODE
being	CODE
ported	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
clr	CODE
why	CODE
force	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
unsigned	CODE
ints	CODE
to	CODE
gain	CODE
cls	CODE
compliance	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
absolutely	CODE
no	CODE
concept	CODE
ever	CODE
unsigned	CODE
integers	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
cls	CODE
compliant	CODE
because	CODE
they're	CODE
not	CODE
interoperable	CODE
between	CODE
certain	CODE
languages	CODE
an	CODE
explicit	CODE
cast	CODE
to	CODE
double	CODE
isn't	CODE
necessary	CODE
identifying	CODE
the	CODE
constant	CODE
as	CODE
50000	CODE
or	CODE
as	CODE
5000d	CODE
is	CODE
sufficient	CODE
it	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
thisopacity	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
double	CODE
value	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
doesn't	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
cram	CODE
a	CODE
decimal	CODE
value	CODE
into	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
generic	CODE
answer	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
generic	CODE
question	CODE
decimal	CODE
vs	CODE
double	CODE
decimal	CODE
for	CODE
monetary	CODE
calculations	CODE
to	CODE
preserve	CODE
the	CODE
precision	CODE
double	CODE
for	CODE
scientific	CODE
calculations	CODE
that	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
get	CODE
affected	CODE
by	CODE
small	CODE
differences	CODE
since	CODE
double	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
type	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
native	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
cpu	CODE
internal	CODE
representation	CODE
is	CODE
stored	CODE
in	CODE
base	CODE
2	CODE
calculations	CODE
made	CODE
with	CODE
double	CODE
perform	CODE
better	CODE
then	CODE
decimal	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
represented	CODE
in	CODE
base	CODE
10	CODE
internally	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
opinion	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
desirable	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
as	CODE
explicit	CODE
as	CODE
possible	CODE
this	CODE
adds	CODE
clarity	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
aids	CODE
your	CODE
fellow	CODE
programmers	CODE
who	CODE
may	CODE
eventually	CODE
read	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
addition	CODE
to	CODE
or	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
appending	CODE
a	CODE
0	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
decimaltodouble	CODE
here	CODE
are	CODE
some	CODE
examples	CODE
very	CODE
roughly	CODE
and	CODE
from	CODE
memory	CODE
since	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
code	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
laptop	CODE
@goyuix	CODE
--	CODE
that's	CODE
excellent	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
written	CODE
from	CODE
memory	CODE
tested	CODE
it	CODE
here	CODE
--	CODE
found	CODE
the	CODE
connection	CODE
wasn't	CODE
opened	CODE
otherwise	CODE
very	CODE
nice	CODE
that's	CODE
definitely	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
happen	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
that	CODE
supports	CODE
linq	CODE
to	CODE
sql	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
more	CODE
fun	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
look	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
alternative	CODE
way	CODE
datareader	CODE
is	CODE
faster	CODE
than	CODE
this	CODE
one	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
done	CODE
swing	CODE
development	CODE
since	CODE
my	CODE
early	CODE
cs	CODE
classes	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
wasn't	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
just	CODE
inherit	CODE
javaxswingabstractbutton	CODE
and	CODE
create	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
pretty	CODE
simple	CODE
to	CODE
wire	CODE
something	CODE
together	CODE
with	CODE
their	CODE
existing	CODE
framework	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
always	CODE
try	CODE
the	CODE
synth	CODE
look	CODE
feel	CODE
you	CODE
provide	CODE
an	CODE
xml	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
acts	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
stylesheet	CODE
along	CODE
with	CODE
any	CODE
images	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
might	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
from	CODE
there	CODE
go	CODE
on	CODE
and	CODE
add	CODE
your	CODE
jbutton	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
normally	CODE
would	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
change	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
setnamestring	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
identify	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
button	CODE
should	CODE
map	CODE
to	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
file	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
file	CODE
might	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
the	CODE
bind	CODE
element	CODE
there	CODE
specifies	CODE
what	CODE
to	CODE
map	CODE
to	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
example	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
apply	CODE
that	CODE
styling	CODE
to	CODE
any	CODE
buttons	CODE
whose	CODE
name	CODE
property	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
dirt	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
useful	CODE
links	CODE
yes	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
pros	CODE
for	CODE
using	CODE
swing	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
ease	CODE
with	CODE
which	CODE
the	CODE
abstract	CODE
controls	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
created	CODE
and	CODE
manipulates	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
and	CODE
dirty	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
extend	CODE
the	CODE
existing	CODE
jbutton	CODE
class	CODE
to	CODE
draw	CODE
a	CODE
circle	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
text	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
by	CODE
overriding	CODE
paintcomponent	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
contents	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
button	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
changed	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
border	CODE
is	CODE
painted	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
paintborder	CODE
method	CODE
the	CODE
getpreferredsize	CODE
method	CODE
also	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
managed	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
dynamically	CODE
support	CODE
changes	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
care	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
taken	CODE
when	CODE
measuring	CODE
font	CODE
metrics	CODE
and	CODE
image	CODE
dimensions	CODE
for	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
control	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
rely	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
approach	CODE
dimensions	CODE
and	CODE
colours	CODE
are	CODE
dynamic	CODE
in	CODE
swing	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
look	CODE
and	CODE
feel	CODE
being	CODE
used	CODE
even	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
metal	CODE
look	CODE
has	CODE
changed	CODE
across	CODE
jre	CODE
versions	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
better	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
abstractbutton	CODE
and	CODE
conform	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
guidelines	CODE
set	CODE
out	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
swing	CODE
api	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
starting	CODE
point	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
javaxswinglookandfeel	CODE
and	CODE
javaxswinguimanager	CODE
classes	CODE
understanding	CODE
the	CODE
anatomy	CODE
of	CODE
lookandfeel	CODE
is	CODE
useful	CODE
for	CODE
writing	CODE
controls	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
look	CODE
and	CODE
feel	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
first	CODE
learning	CODE
java	CODE
we	CODE
had	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
yahtzee	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
thought	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
cool	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
custom	CODE
swing	CODE
components	CODE
and	CODE
containers	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
just	CODE
drawing	CODE
everything	CODE
on	CODE
one	CODE
jpanel	CODE
the	CODE
benefit	CODE
of	CODE
extending	CODE
swing	CODE
components	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
ability	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE
keyboard	CODE
shortcuts	CODE
and	CODE
other	CODE
accessibility	CODE
features	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
do	CODE
just	CODE
by	CODE
having	CODE
a	CODE
paint	CODE
method	CODE
print	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
picture	CODE

return	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
haven't	CODE
experimented	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
layout	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
gui	CODE
your	CODE

could	CODE
look	CODE
completely	CODE
different	CODE

finally	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
missed	CODE
anything	CODE

doubling	CODE
the	CODE

work	CODE
partially	CODE
the	CODE

inserted	CODE

the	CODE

i	CODE
found	CODE
a	CODE

that	CODE
indicated	CODE
the	CODE

with	CODE

this	CODE
suppressed	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE

too	CODE

but	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
windows	CODE
network	CODE
load	CODE
balancing	CODE
nlb	CODE
should	CODE
handle	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
off	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
head	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
you'd	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
maintain	CODE
some	CODE
form	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
that	CODE
reflects	CODE
the	CODE
items	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
dropdown	CODE
list	CODE
you'd	CODE
also	CODE
need	CODE
a	CODE
reference	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
currently	CODE
activeselected	CODE
item	CODE
each	CODE
time	CODE
keyup	CODE
or	CODE
keydown	CODE
is	CODE
fired	CODE
update	CODE
the	CODE
reference	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
activeselected	CODE
item	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
to	CODE
provide	CODE
highlighting	CODE
information	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
ui	CODE
add	CODE
or	CODE
remove	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
name	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
styled	CODE
via	CODE
css	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
item	CODE
is	CODE
activeselected	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
also	CODE
this	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
biggy	CODE
but	CODE
innerhtml	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
standard	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
createtextnode	CODE
createelement	CODE
and	CODE
appendchild	CODE
for	CODE
standard	CODE
ways	CODE
of	CODE
creating	CODE
data	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
also	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
about	CODE
attaching	CODE
event	CODE
handlers	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
doing	CODE
so	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
html	CODE
attribute	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
things	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
creating	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
using	CODE
an	CODE
unnecessary	CODE
toplevel	CODE
window	CODE
named	CODE
window	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
delete	CODE
these	CODE
lines	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
flow	CODE
doesn't	CODE
seem	CODE
quite	CODE
right	CODE
gtk_main	CODE
starts	CODE
the	CODE
gtk	CODE
main	CODE
loop	CODE
which	CODE
blocks	CODE
until	CODE
something	CODE
exits	CODE
it	CODE
gtk_dialog_run	CODE
also	CODE
starts	CODE
a	CODE
main	CODE
loop	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
exits	CODE
as	CODE
soon	CODE
as	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
buttons	CODE
is	CODE
clicked	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
enough	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
remove	CODE
the	CODE
gtk_init_add	CODE
and	CODE
gtk_main	CODE
calls	CODE
and	CODE
simply	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
gtk_widget_destroy	CODE
call	CODE
is	CODE
unnecessary	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
dialog	CODE
window	CODE
is	CODE
automatically	CODE
destroyed	CODE
when	CODE
gtk_dialog_run	CODE
returns	CODE
hmm	CODE
ok	CODE
i'd	CODE
suggest	CODE
code	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
struct	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
pass	CODE
around	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
pieces	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
the	CODE
gtk_idle_add	CODE
call	CODE
adds	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
run	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
loop	CODE
is	CODE
running	CODE
and	CODE
idle	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
false	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
display_dialog	CODE
call	CODE
means	CODE
that	CODE
it's	CODE
only	CODE
run	CODE
once	CODE
after	CODE
we	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
dialog	CODE
we	CODE
quit	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
loop	CODE
that'll	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
gtk_main	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
main	CODE
messagebox	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
return	CODE
and	CODE
you'll	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
from	CODE
there	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE
this	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
too	CODE
basic	CODE
or	CODE
limited	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
but	CODE
couldn't	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
stringsplit	CODE
on	CODE
each	CODE
line	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
remembering	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
array	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
line	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
spit	CODE
each	CODE
line's	CODE
array	CODE
data	CODE
out	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
proper	CODE
xml	CODE
elements	CODE
padding	CODE
each	CODE
iteration	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
loop	CODE
maybe	CODE
this	CODE
might	CODE
help	CODE
jsefa	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
read	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
tool	CODE
and	CODE
serialize	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
understand	CODE
why	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
it	CODE
sounds	CODE
almost	CODE
like	CODE
cargo	CODE
cult	CODE
coding	CODE
converting	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
doesn't	CODE
add	CODE
any	CODE
value	CODE
your	CODE
program	CODE
is	CODE
already	CODE
reading	CODE
the	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
so	CODE
arguing	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
xml	CODE
doesn't	CODE
work	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
hand	CODE
reading	CODE
the	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
doing	CODE
something	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
values	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
serializing	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
does	CODE
make	CODE
sense	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
as	CODE
using	CODE
xml	CODE
can	CODE
make	CODE
sense	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
supposedly	CODE
already	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
means	CODE
of	CODE
serializing	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
there's	CODE
no	CODE
ready-made	CODE
library	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
but	CODE
producing	CODE
a	CODE
tool	CODE
capable	CODE
of	CODE
translating	CODE
from	CODE
csv	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
should	CODE
only	CODE
require	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
crude	CODE
csv	CODE
parser	CODE
and	CODE
hook	CODE
up	CODE
jdom	CODE
or	CODE
your	CODE
xml	CODE
java	CODE
library	CODE
of	CODE
choice	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
glue	CODE
code	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
nothing	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
without	CODE
you	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
writing	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
2	CODE
separate	CODE
library	CODE
a	CODE
csv	CODE
parser	CODE
framework	CODE
an	CODE
xml	CODE
serialization	CODE
framework	CODE
the	CODE
csv	CODE
parser	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
recommend	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
fun	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
csv	CODE
parser	CODE
is	CODE
opencsv	CODE
a	CODE
sourceforge	CODE
project	CODE
for	CODE
parsing	CODE
csv	CODE
data	CODE
the	CODE
xml	CODE
serialization	CODE
framework	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
scale	CODE
in	CODE
case	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
transform	CODE
large	CODE
or	CODE
huge	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
to	CODE
xml	CODE
my	CODE
recommendation	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
sun	CODE
java	CODE
streaming	CODE
xml	CODE
parser	CODE
framework	CODE
see	CODE
here	CODE
which	CODE
allows	CODE
pull-parsing	CODE
and	CODE
serialization	CODE
ie	CODE
8	CODE
is	CODE
supposed	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
better	CODE
tools	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
ie	CODE
developer	CODE
toolbar	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
good	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
find	CODE
firebug	CODE
lite	CODE
useful	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
its	CODE
bookmarklet	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
especially	CODE
useful	CODE
when	CODE
debugging	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
user's	CODE
machine	CODE
this	CODE
has	CODE
religious	CODE
war	CODE
potential	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
internally	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
-	CODE
using	CODE
both	CODE
will	CODE
lead	CODE
to	CODE
maintenance	CODE
problems	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
road	CODE
eg	CODE
somebody	CODE
adds	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
setter	CODE
that	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
every	CODE
time	CODE
that	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
set	CODE
internally	CODE
wo	CODE
that	CODE
setter	CODE
being	CODE
called	CODE
it	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
say	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
student	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
name	CODE
property	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
your	CODE
get	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
pull	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
hasn't	CODE
been	CODE
retrieved	CODE
already	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
reducing	CODE
unnecessary	CODE
calls	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
now	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
private	CODE
integer	CODE
counter	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
counts	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
times	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
called	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
get	CODE
method	CODE
from	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
produce	CODE
an	CODE
invalid	CODE
count	CODE
am	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
going	CODE
overboard	CODE
here	CODE
perhaps	CODE
another	CODE
approach	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
utilize	CODE
a	CODE
privateprotected	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
getting	CODE
cachingdbetc	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
public	CODE
wrapper	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE
that	CODE
increments	CODE
the	CODE
count	CODE
php	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
itself	CODE
php	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
still	CODE
use	CODE
that	CODE
first	CODE
argument	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
else	CODE
like	CODE
sending	CODE
a	CODE
flag	CODE
for	CODE
whether	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
used	CODE
cached	CODE
data	CODE
here	CODE
perhaps	CODE
well	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
with	CODE
c#	CODE
30	CODE
properties'	CODE
default	CODE
implementation	CODE
the	CODE
decision	CODE
is	CODE
taken	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
possibly	CODE
private	CODE
property	CODE
setter	CODE
i	CODE
personally	CODE
only	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
private	CODE
member-behind	CODE
when	CODE
not	CODE
doing	CODE
so	CODE
would	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
fall	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
less	CODE
than	CODE
desirable	CODE
state	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
when	CODE
initializing	CODE
or	CODE
when	CODE
cachinglazy	CODE
loading	CODE
is	CODE
involved	CODE
as	CODE
stated	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
comments	CODE
sometimes	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
sometimes	CODE
you	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
the	CODE
great	CODE
part	CODE
about	CODE
private	CODE
variables	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
places	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
change	CODE
something	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
does	CODE
something	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
matter	CODE
you	CODE
decide	CODE
the	CODE
opposite	CODE
case	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
made	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
and	CODE
somebody	CODE
changes	CODE
the	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
they	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
analyze	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
places	CODE
the	CODE
getter	CODE
and	CODE
setter	CODE
is	CODE
used	CODE
internally	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
messes	CODE
something	CODE
up	CODE
personally	CODE
i	CODE
feel	CODE
like	CODE
it's	CODE
important	CODE
to	CODE
remain	CODE
consistent	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
getters	CODE
and	CODE
setters	CODE
use	CODE
them	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
time	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
access	CODE
a	CODE
field	CODE
directly	CODE
is	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
accessor	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
overhead	CODE
it	CODE
may	CODE
feel	CODE
like	CODE
you're	CODE
bloating	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
unnecessarily	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
certainly	CODE
save	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
headache	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
future	CODE
the	CODE
classic	CODE
example	CODE
later	CODE
on	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
desire	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
that	CODE
field	CODE
works	CODE
maybe	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
calculated	CODE
on-the-fly	CODE
or	CODE
maybe	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
type	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
backing	CODE
store	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
accessing	CODE
properties	CODE
directly	CODE
a	CODE
change	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
break	CODE
an	CODE
awful	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
swell	CODE
foop	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
wrong	CODE
because	CODE
i'm	CODE
autodidact	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
never	CODE
user	CODE
public	CODE
properties	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
java	CODE
clases	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
allways	CODE
private	CODE
or	CODE
protected	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
outside	CODE

purposes	CODE

for	CODE
inside	CODE
class	CODE
code	CODE
if	CODE
getter	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
trivial	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
directly	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
allways	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
setter	CODE
methods	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
easily	CODE
add	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
fire	CODE
events	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
wish	CODE
doesn't	CODE
this	CODE
depend	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
hardware	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
threads	CODE
and	CODE
stuff	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
test	CODE
and	CODE
run	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
increasing	CODE
amounts	CODE
of	CODE
threads	CODE

and	CODE
see	CODE
what	CODE
seems	CODE
best	CODE
it	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
what	CODE
kind	CODE

you	CODE
are	CODE
building	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
representative	CODE
test	CODE
scenario	CODE
and	CODE
start	CODE
hammering	CODE
away	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
definitive	CODE
answer	CODE
besides	CODE
your	CODE
use	CODE

it	CODE
also	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
cpu	CODE
memory	CODE
front-side	CODE

seriously	CODE
just	CODE

what	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
when	CODE
working	CODE
against	CODE

unknown	CODE
performance	CODE
was	CODE
to	CODE
measure	CODE
turnaround	CODE
time	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE

i	CODE
kept	CODE
upping	CODE
the	CODE

improved	CODE
well	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE

but	CODE
whatever	CODE
there	CODE
were	CODE
moving	CODE
averages	CODE
and	CODE
all	CODE
sorts	CODE
of	CODE
metrics	CODE
involved	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
take-away	CODE
lesson	CODE
was	CODE
just	CODE
adapt	CODE
to	CODE
how	CODE
things	CODE
are	CODE
working	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
moment	CODE
you	CODE
never	CODE
know	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
dbas	CODE
will	CODE
improve	CODE
performance	CODE
or	CODE
hardware	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
upgraded	CODE
or	CODE
perhaps	CODE
another	CODE
process	CODE
will	CODE
come	CODE
along	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
while	CODE
you're	CODE
running	CODE
so	CODE
adapt	CODE
oh	CODE
and	CODE
another	CODE
thing	CODE
avoid	CODE
process	CODE
switches	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
-	CODE
batch	CODE
things	CODE
up	CODE
oh	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
make	CODE
this	CODE
clear	CODE
this	CODE
all	CODE
happened	CODE
at	CODE
run	CODE
time	CODE
not	CODE
during	CODE
development	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
distinct	CODE
operator	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
grant	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
maintain	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
values	CODE
so	CODE
your	CODE
query	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
try	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
this	CODE
should	CODE
work	CODE
for	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
activemq	CODE
works	CODE
well	CODE
with	CODE
c#	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
springnet	CODE
integrations	CODE
and	CODE
nms	CODE
a	CODE
post	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
links	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
you	CODE
started	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
direction	CODE
is	CODE
here	CODE
also	CODE
consider	CODE
using	CODE
msmq	CODE
the	CODE
systemmessaging	CODE
namespace	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
net	CODE
based	CODE
asynchronous	CODE
messaging	CODE
solution	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
options	CODE
here	CODE
sorry	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
isn't	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
asking	CODE
for	CODE
have	CODE
you	CODE
considered	CODE
some	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
cache	CODE
behind	CODE
the	CODE
scenes	CODE
that	CODE
acts	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
bucket	CODE
system	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
asynchronous	CODE
sockets	CODE
in	CODE
cc++	CODE
using	CODE
winsock	CODE
basicly	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
by	CODE
accepting	CODE
requests	CODE
and	CODE
sends	CODE
an	CODE
immediate	CODE
response	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
app	CODE
and	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
finally	CODE
gets	CODE
around	CODE
to	CODE
finding	CODE
your	CODE
record	CODE
it	CODE
updates	CODE
it	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
app	CODE
via	CODE
ajax	CODE
or	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
technology	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
choice	CODE
since	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
programmer	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
provide	CODE
any	CODE
specific	CODE
example	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE
you	CODE
tried	CODE
old	CODE
builds	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
a	CODE
reason	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
keep	CODE
going	CODE
further	CODE
back	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
repository	CODE
history	CODE
and	CODE
seeing	CODE
exactly	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
bug	CODE
was	CODE
introduced	CODE
otherwise	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
suggest	CODE
adding	CODE
simple	CODE
logging	CODE
of	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
to	CODE
help	CODE
track	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
loss	CODE

what	CODE
specifically	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
log	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE

what	CODE

can	CODE

that	CODE

give	CODE
further	CODE
insight	CODE
on	CODE
what	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
for	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
my	CODE

be	CODE
a	CODE

such	CODE
as	CODE

how	CODE

lived	CODE

that	CODE
arn't	CODE

the	CODE
reason	CODE

because	CODE
idle	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
accessing	CODE

when	CODE
you	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE

it	CODE
works	CODE
nicely	CODE

your	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE

some	CODE

only	CODE
if	CODE
that	CODE

out	CODE
ok	CODE
for	CODE
both	CODE

again	CODE
this	CODE

probably	CODE
not	CODE

and	CODE
not	CODE
elegant	CODE
in	CODE
99%	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
cases	CODE
that	CODE

the	CODE

many	CODE

zombiesheep	CODE

dead-on	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
gotcha	CODE
that	CODE

that	CODE
this	CODE

every	CODE

if	CODE
one	CODE

both	CODE
evaluate	CODE

note	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE

regarding	CODE
how	CODE
much	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
expression	CODE

evaluated	CODE
is	CODE
known	CODE

a	CODE

here	CODE
stop	CODE

determined	CODE
before	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE

such	CODE

only	CODE

this	CODE

even	CODE
though	CODE
the	CODE

thus	CODE

this	CODE
same	CODE

exists	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE

some	CODE

have	CODE
interesting	CODE
situations	CODE
where	CODE

in	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
order	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
specifically	CODE
thinking	CODE
of	CODE
ruby	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
sure	CODE
they	CODE
borrowed	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
elsewhere	CODE
probably	CODE
perl	CODE
the	CODE
expressions	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
will	CODE
stay	CODE
left	CODE
to	CODE
right	CODE

for	CODE
example	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
will	CODE
evaluate	CODE
messagenil	CODE
first	CODE
then	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
evaluates	CODE

false	CODE
unless	CODE

like	CODE

it	CODE

when	CODE
the	CODE

it's	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
interesting	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
structure	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
sometimes	CODE
i	CODE
personally	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
for	CODE
very	CODE
short	CODE
1	CODE

like	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
edit	CODE

make	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
clearer	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE

the	CODE

the	CODE

it's	CODE

what	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE
when	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
bitwise	CODE
operator	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
short-circuited	CODE

suppose	CODE
you	CODE

write	CODE

in	CODE

that's	CODE
each	CODE

is	CODE
the	CODE
term	CODE
given	CODE
for	CODE
letting	CODE
you	CODE

custom	CODE
behaviour	CODE
for	CODE
operators	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE

so	CODE
on	CODE

you	CODE
use	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
specifically	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
evaluate	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE

most	CODE
likely	CODE
because	CODE
they	CODE
have	CODE
side-effects	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
even	CODE
though	CODE
the	CODE
final	CODE

be	CODE

thus	CODE
not	CODE
execute	CODE

part	CODE

that	CODE

for	CODE

they're	CODE

they	CODE

for	CODE
both	CODE

this	CODE
may	CODE
seem	CODE
confusing	CODE
as	CODE
usually	CODE
what's	CODE
innermost	CODE
is	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
right-hand	CODE
side	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
line	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
it's	CODE
going	CODE
backwards	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
things	CODE
happen	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
call	CODE
getaddress	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE

and	CODE
the	CODE

getsummary	CODE
assign	CODE
this	CODE
value	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
i	CODE
realise	CODE
this	CODE
question	CODE
has	CODE
already	CODE
been	CODE
answered	CODE
but	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
throw	CODE
in	CODE
another	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
information	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
related	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
topic	CODE
in	CODE
languages	CODE
like	CODE
c++	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
actually	CODE
overload	CODE
the	CODE
behaviour	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
and	CODE
||	CODE
operators	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
highly	CODE
recommended	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
overload	CODE
this	CODE
behaviour	CODE
you	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
forcing	CODE
the	CODE
evaluation	CODE
of	CODE
both	CODE
sides	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
operation	CODE
this	CODE
does	CODE
two	CODE
things	CODE
it	CODE
breaks	CODE
the	CODE
lazy	CODE
evaluation	CODE
mechanism	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
overload	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
which	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
invoked	CODE
and	CODE
hence	CODE
both	CODE
parameters	CODE
are	CODE
evaluated	CODE
before	CODE
calling	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
evaluation	CODE
of	CODE
said	CODE
parameters	CODE
isn't	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
and	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
compiler	CODE
specific	CODE
hence	CODE
the	CODE
objects	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
behave	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
manner	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
do	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
examples	CODE
listed	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE

cheers	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
orion's	CODE
responses	CODE
i'll	CODE
add	CODE
two	CODE
things	CODE
the	CODE
left-to-right	CODE
still	CODE
applies	CODE
first	CODE
the	CODE
inner-to-outer	CODE
to	CODE
ensure	CODE
that	CODE
all	CODE
arguments	CODE
are	CODE
resolved	CODE
before	CODE
calling	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
say	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
example	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
execution	CODE
getaddressorion	CODE
getsummaryorion	CODE
getaddresschris	CODE
getsummarychris	CODE
foo	CODE
assigns	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
speak	CODE
about	CODE
c#'s	CODE
legal	CODE
requirements	CODE
although	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
test	CODE
a	CODE
similar	CODE
example	CODE
using	CODE
mono	CODE
before	CODE
writing	CODE
this	CODE
post	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
order	CODE
is	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
for	CODE
completeness	CODE
since	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
language-agnostic	CODE
thread	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
languages	CODE
like	CODE
c	CODE
and	CODE
c++	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
unless	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
sequence	CODE
point	CODE
references	CODE
1	CODE
2	CODE
in	CODE
answering	CODE
the	CODE
thread's	CODE
question	CODE
however	CODE
and	CODE
||	CODE
are	CODE
sequence	CODE
points	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
unless	CODE
overloaded	CODE
also	CODE
see	CODE
oj's	CODE
excellent	CODE
answer	CODE
so	CODE
some	CODE
examples	CODE
foo	CODE
bar	CODE
foo	CODE
bar	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
foo	CODE
is	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
before	CODE
bar	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
latter	CODE
is	CODE
run	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
since	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
sequence	CODE
point	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
no	CODE
such	CODE
guarantee	CODE
is	CODE
made	CODE
in	CODE
c	CODE
and	CODE
c++	CODE
and	CODE
indeed	CODE
bar	CODE
can	CODE
run	CODE
before	CODE
foo	CODE
or	CODE
vice	CODE
versa	CODE
c#	CODE
left	CODE
to	CODE
right	CODE
and	CODE
processing	CODE
stops	CODE
if	CODE
a	CODE

true	CODE
is	CODE
found	CODE
zombie	CODE
sheep	CODE
is	CODE
wrong	CODE
not	CODE
enough	CODE
rep	CODE
to	CODE
down	CODE
vote	CODE
it	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
operator	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
||	CODE
operator	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
of	CODE
evaluation	CODE
will	CODE
stop	CODE
if	CODE
a	CODE
false	CODE
is	CODE
found	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
of	CODE
||	CODE
evaluation	CODE
stops	CODE
if	CODE
a	CODE
true	CODE
is	CODE
found	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
open	CODE
the	CODE
locfile	CODE
in	CODE
binary	CODE
using	CODE
rb	CODE
well	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
go	CODE
under	CODE
the	CODE
properties	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
windows	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
*nix	CODE
environment	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
notice	CODE
two	CODE
sizes	CODE
one	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
sector	CODE
size	CODE
and	CODE
one	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
size	CODE
the	CODE
sector	CODE
size	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
sectors	CODE
in	CODE
bytes	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
up	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
hard	CODE
disk	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
two	CODE
files	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
sector	CODE
with	CODE
most	CODE
modern	CODE
file	CODE
systems	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
file	CODE
fills	CODE
up	CODE
half	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
sector	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE
sector	CODE
is	CODE
marked	CODE
as	CODE
filled	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
comparing	CODE
the	CODE
sector	CODE
file	CODE
size	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
file	CODE
size	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
ftp	CODE
server	CODE
or	CODE
vice	CODE
versa	CODE
small	CODE
files	CODE
take	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
node	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
filesystem	CODE
whatever	CODE
size	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
my	CODE
host	CODE
tends	CODE
to	CODE
report	CODE
all	CODE
small	CODE
files	CODE
as	CODE
4kb	CODE
in	CODE
ftp	CODE
but	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
shell	CODE
gives	CODE
an	CODE
accurate	CODE
size	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
'feature'	CODE
common	CODE
to	CODE
ftp	CODE
clients	CODE
one	CODE
possibility	CODE
is	CODE
hudson	CODE
it's	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
but	CODE
there's	CODE
integration	CODE
with	CODE
python	CODE
projects	CODE
hudson	CODE
embraces	CODE
python	CODE
i've	CODE
never	CODE
tried	CODE
it	CODE
myself	CODE
however	CODE
update	CODE

2011	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
trademark	CODE
dispute	CODE
hudson	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
renamed	CODE
to	CODE
jenkins	CODE
we	CODE
run	CODE
buildbot	CODE
-	CODE
trac	CODE
at	CODE
work	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
used	CODE
it	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
since	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
base	CODE
isn't	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
release	CODE
cycle	CODE
yet	CODE
but	CODE
we	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
tests	CODE
on	CODE
different	CODE
environments	CODE
osxlinuxwin	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
sends	CODE
emails	CODE
--and	CODE
it's	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
second	CODE
the	CODE
buildbot	CODE
-	CODE
trac	CODE
integration	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
more	CODE
information	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
integration	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
buildbot	CODE
website	CODE
at	CODE
my	CODE
previous	CODE
job	CODE
we	CODE
wrote	CODE
and	CODE
used	CODE
the	CODE
plugin	CODE
they	CODE
mention	CODE
tracbb	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
plugin	CODE
does	CODE
is	CODE
rewriting	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
buildbot	CODE
urls	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
buildbot	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
trac	CODE
httpexamplecomtracbb	CODE
the	CODE
really	CODE
nice	CODE
thing	CODE
about	CODE
buildbot	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
configuration	CODE
is	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
integrate	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
python	CODE
code	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
configuration	CODE
it's	CODE
also	CODE
very	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
buildsteps	CODE
to	CODE
execute	CODE
specific	CODE
tasks	CODE
we	CODE
used	CODE
buildsteps	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
from	CODE
svn	CODE
pull	CODE
the	CODE
dependencies	CODE
publish	CODE
test	CODE
results	CODE
to	CODE
webdav	CODE
etcetera	CODE
i	CODE
wrote	CODE
an	CODE
x10	CODE
interface	CODE
so	CODE
we	CODE
could	CODE
send	CODE
signals	CODE
with	CODE
build	CODE
results	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
build	CODE
failed	CODE
we	CODE
switched	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
red	CODE
lava	CODE
lamp	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
build	CODE
succeeded	CODE
a	CODE
green	CODE
lava	CODE
lamp	CODE
switched	CODE
on	CODE
good	CODE
times	CODE
-	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
handled	CODE
exactly	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
way	CODE
for	CODE
webstart	CODE
but	CODE
we	CODE
ran	CODE
into	CODE
this	CODE
situation	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
desktop	CODE
application	CODE
when	CODE
dealing	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
native	CODE
libraries	CODE
dlls	CODE
in	CODE
our	CODE
case	CODE
loading	CODE
liba	CODE
before	CODE
libb	CODE
should	CODE
work	CODE
unless	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
libraries	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
dependency	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
unaccounted	CODE
for	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
path	CODE
my	CODE
understanding	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
once	CODE
it	CODE
gets	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
system	CODE
loadlibrary	CODE
call	CODE
ie	CODE
java	CODE
has	CODE
found	CODE
the	CODE
library	CODE
in	CODE
its	CODE
javalibrarypath	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
now	CODE
telling	CODE
the	CODE
os	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
it	CODE
-	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
completely	CODE
dependent	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
operating	CODE
system	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
any	CODE
dependent	CODE
libraries	CODE
because	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
operating	CODE
system	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
loading	CODE
the	CODE
library	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
os	CODE
only	CODE
knows	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
path	CODE
that	CODE
seems	CODE
hard	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
webstart	CODE
app	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
around	CODE
this	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
involve	CODE
static	CODE
compiling	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
shuffle	CODE
where	CODE
your	CODE
libraries	CODE
are	CODE
-	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
unsure	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
classloader	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
override	CODE
loadlibrary	CODE
and	CODE
findlibrary	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
locate	CODE
your	CODE
libraries	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
a	CODE
jar	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
classpath	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
also	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
aware	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
native	CODE
library	CODE
dependencies	CODE
ie	CODE
libb	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
liba	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
libx	CODE
then	CODE
when	CODE
loading	CODE
libb	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
catch	CODE
yourself	CODE
and	CODE
ensure	CODE
you	CODE
load	CODE
liba	CODE
first	CODE
and	CODE
in	CODE
checking	CODE
that	CODE
notice	CODE
and	CODE
load	CODE
libx	CODE
first	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
os	CODE
doesn't	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
library	CODE
that	CODE
isn't	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
path	CODE
it's	CODE
klunky	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
painful	CODE
but	CODE
ensuring	CODE
java	CODE
finds	CODE
them	CODE
and	CODE
loads	CODE
them	CODE
all	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
order	CODE
can	CODE
work	CODE
hrm	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
about	CODE

there	CODE
is	CODE
another	CODE

open	CODE
your	CODE

change	CODE
it	CODE

if	CODE
its	CODE

on	CODE
both	CODE
sides	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE

send	CODE
the	CODE
byte[]	CODE
result	CODE
trusting	CODE
your	CODE

to	CODE
be	CODE
fully	CODE

can	CODE
be	CODE
trouble	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
pay	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
overhead	CODE
both	CODE
cpu	CODE

network	CODE
but	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
safe	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
populate	CODE
each	CODE
member	CODE
variable	CODE
by	CODE
hand	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
generalize	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
primitives	CODE
are	CODE
concerned	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE

the	CODE

i've	CODE
had	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE

i	CODE
had	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
different	CODE

definitely	CODE

want	CODE

write	CODE
the	CODE

here's	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
i	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
generalize	CODE
the	CODE
deserialization	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
byte[]	CODE
most	CODE
people	CODE
use	CODE
net	CODE
serialization	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
faster	CODE
binary	CODE
and	CODE
slower	CODE
xml	CODE
formatter	CODE
they	CODE
both	CODE
depend	CODE
on	CODE
reflection	CODE

are	CODE
version	CODE

to	CODE
certain	CODE
degree	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE

what	CODE

is	CODE
that's	CODE
why	CODE
a	CODE

use	CODE

datatables	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
quicker	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
lightweight	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
only	CODE
pulling	CODE
a	CODE

its	CODE
your	CODE

between	CODE

it	CODE
really	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
you're	CODE
bringing	CODE
back	CODE
since	CODE
a	CODE
dataset	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
effect	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
datatable	CODE
objects	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
return	CODE
multiple	CODE
distinct	CODE
sets	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
and	CODE
therefore	CODE
more	CODE
manageable	CODE
object	CODE
performance-wise	CODE
you're	CODE
more	CODE
likely	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
inefficiency	CODE
from	CODE
unoptimized	CODE

than	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
wrong	CODE
choice	CODE
of	CODE
net	CODE
construct	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
that's	CODE
been	CODE
my	CODE
experience	CODE
one	CODE
feature	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
dataset	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
call	CODE
multiple	CODE
select	CODE
statements	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
stored	CODE
procedures	CODE
the	CODE
dataset	CODE
will	CODE
have	CODE
one	CODE
datatable	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
three	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
iterate	CODE
over	CODE
a	CODE
result	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
both	CODE
readability	CODE
and	CODE
performance	CODE
is	CODE
usually	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
built-in	CODE

this	CODE
can	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
bad	CODE
side	CODE
effects	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE

is	CODE
large	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
wait	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
entire	CODE

be	CODE
returned	CODE

your	CODE

you	CODE

sure	CODE
this	CODE

if	CODE
you	CODE
hack	CODE
at	CODE
it	CODE
hard	CODE
enough	CODE
but	CODE
i'd	CODE
suggest	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
idea	CODE
'windows'	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
see	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
screen	CODE
are	CODE
highly	CODE
coupled	CODE
to	CODE
processes	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
each	CODE
process	CODE
which	CODE
displays	CODE
any	CODE
gui	CODE
is	CODE
expected	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
message	CODE
loop	CODE
which	CODE
processes	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
messages	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
involved	CODE
with	CODE
creating	CODE

managing	CODE
windows	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
'clicked	CODE
the	CODE

'closed	CODE
the	CODE
app'	CODE
'redraw	CODE
the	CODE

and	CODE
so	CODE
on	CODE
because	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
or	CODE
less	CODE
assumed	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
message	CODE
loop	CODE
it	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
available	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
lifetime	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
process	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
windows	CODE
might	CODE
send	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
'quit'	CODE
message	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
message	CODE
loop	CODE
available	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
that	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
you've	CODE
got	CODE
nothing	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

your	CODE
best	CODE
bet	CODE
is	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
fake	CODE

is	CODE
never	CODE

the	CODE

you	CODE

probably	CODE
something	CODE

i	CODE

the	CODE

you	CODE

show	CODE
them	CODE

the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE

is	CODE
a	CODE

you	CODE

example	CODE
the	CODE

a	CODE

200-3000	CODE
an	CODE

unambiguously	CODE

an	CODE

can	CODE
unambiguously	CODE
be	CODE
interpreted	CODE
as	CODE
91	CODE
centimeters	CODE
and	CODE
23	CODE
millimeters	CODE
from	CODE
my	CODE
experience	CODE
and	CODE
from	CODE
what	CODE
i've	CODE
read	CODE
across	CODE
the	CODE
internet	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
it	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
cpu	CODE
speed	CODE
operating	CODE
system	CODE
flavor	CODE
of	CODE
linux	CODE
etc	CODE
maybe	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
bigger	CODE
problems	CODE
gettimeofday	CODE
can	CODE
result	CODE
in	CODE
incorrect	CODE
timings	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
processes	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
system	CODE
that	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
timer	CODE
ie	CODE
ntpd	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
normal	CODE
linux	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
the	CODE
resolution	CODE
of	CODE
gettimeofday	CODE
is	CODE
10us	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
jump	CODE
forward	CODE
and	CODE
backward	CODE
and	CODE
time	CODE
consequently	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
processes	CODE
running	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
system	CODE
this	CODE
effectively	CODE
makes	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
question	CODE
no	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
clock_gettimeclock_monotonic	CODE
for	CODE
timing	CODE
intervals	CODE
it	CODE
suffers	CODE
from	CODE
several	CODE
less	CODE
issues	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
multi-core	CODE
systems	CODE
and	CODE
external	CODE
clock	CODE
settings	CODE
also	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
clock_getres	CODE
function	CODE
high	CODE
resolution	CODE
low	CODE
overhead	CODE
timing	CODE
for	CODE
intel	CODE
processors	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
on	CODE
intel	CODE
hardware	CODE
here's	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
cpu	CODE
real-time	CODE
instruction	CODE
counter	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
tell	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
cpu	CODE
cycles	CODE
executed	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
processor	CODE
was	CODE
booted	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
the	CODE
finest-grained	CODE
counter	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
for	CODE
performance	CODE
measurement	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
cpu	CODE
cycles	CODE
on	CODE
linux	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
cpu	CODE
speed	CODE
from	CODE
proccpuinfo	CODE
and	CODE
divide	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
seconds	CODE
converting	CODE
this	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
double	CODE
is	CODE
quite	CODE
handy	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
run	CODE
this	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
box	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
intel	CODE
developer's	CODE
guide	CODE
that	CODE
gives	CODE
tons	CODE
of	CODE
detail	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
says	CODE
microseconds	CODE
explicitly	CODE
but	CODE
says	CODE
the	CODE
resolution	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
clock	CODE
is	CODE
unspecified	CODE
i	CODE
suppose	CODE
resolution	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
context	CODE
means	CODE
how	CODE
the	CODE
smallest	CODE
amount	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
ever	CODE
be	CODE
incremented	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
is	CODE
defined	CODE
as	CODE
having	CODE
microseconds	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
unit	CODE
of	CODE
measurement	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
mean	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
clock	CODE
or	CODE
operating	CODE
system	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
capable	CODE
of	CODE
measuring	CODE
that	CODE
finely	CODE
like	CODE
other	CODE
people	CODE
have	CODE
suggested	CODE
gettimeofday	CODE
is	CODE
bad	CODE
because	CODE
setting	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
can	CODE
cause	CODE
clock	CODE
skew	CODE
and	CODE
throw	CODE
off	CODE
your	CODE
calculation	CODE
clock_gettimeclock_monotonic	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
and	CODE
clock_getres	CODE
will	CODE
tell	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
precision	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
clock	CODE
@bernard	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
admit	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
example	CODE
went	CODE
straight	CODE
over	CODE
my	CODE
head	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
compile	CODE
and	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
though	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
safe	CODE
for	CODE
smp	CODE
systems	CODE
or	CODE
speedstep	CODE
that's	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
question	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
code's	CODE
ok	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
practical	CODE
standpoint	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
company	CODE
every	CODE
day	CODE
and	CODE
we	CODE
run	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
wide	CODE
array	CODE
of	CODE
boxes	CODE
everything	CODE
from	CODE
2-8	CODE
cores	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
ymmv	CODE
etc	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
reliable	CODE
and	CODE
low-overhead	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
context	CODE
switch	CODE
into	CODE
system-space	CODE
method	CODE
of	CODE
timing	CODE
generally	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
is	CODE
declare	CODE
the	CODE
block	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
assembler	CODE
and	CODE
volatile	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
optimizer	CODE
will	CODE
leave	CODE
it	CODE
alone	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
cpuid	CODE
instruction	CODE
in	CODE
addition	CODE
to	CODE
getting	CODE
some	CODE
cpu	CODE
information	CODE
which	CODE
we	CODE
don't	CODE
do	CODE
anything	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
synchronizes	CODE
the	CODE
cpu's	CODE
execution	CODE
buffer	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
timings	CODE
aren't	CODE
affected	CODE
by	CODE
out-of-order	CODE
execution	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
rdtsc	CODE
read	CODE
timestamp	CODE
execution	CODE
this	CODE
fetches	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
machine	CODE
cycles	CODE
executed	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
processor	CODE
was	CODE
reset	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
64-bit	CODE
value	CODE
so	CODE
with	CODE
current	CODE
cpu	CODE
speeds	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
wrap	CODE
around	CODE
every	CODE
194	CODE
years	CODE
or	CODE
so	CODE
interestingly	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
pentium	CODE
reference	CODE
they	CODE
note	CODE
it	CODE
wraps	CODE
around	CODE
every	CODE
5800	CODE
years	CODE
or	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
lines	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
values	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
registers	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
variables	CODE
hi	CODE
and	CODE
lo	CODE
and	CODE
put	CODE
that	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
64-bit	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
specific	CODE
notes	CODE
out-of-order	CODE
execution	CODE
can	CODE
cause	CODE
incorrect	CODE
results	CODE
so	CODE
we	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
cpuid	CODE
instruction	CODE
which	CODE
in	CODE
addition	CODE
to	CODE
giving	CODE
you	CODE
some	CODE
information	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
cpu	CODE
also	CODE
synchronizes	CODE
any	CODE
out-of-order	CODE
instruction	CODE
execution	CODE
most	CODE
os's	CODE
synchronize	CODE
the	CODE
counters	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
cpus	CODE
when	CODE
they	CODE
start	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
to	CODE
within	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
nano-seconds	CODE
the	CODE
hibernating	CODE
comment	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
true	CODE
but	CODE
in	CODE
practice	CODE
you	CODE
probably	CODE
don't	CODE
care	CODE
about	CODE
timings	CODE
across	CODE
hibernation	CODE
boundaries	CODE
regarding	CODE
speedstep	CODE
newer	CODE
intel	CODE
cpus	CODE
compensate	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
speed	CODE
changes	CODE
and	CODE
returns	CODE
an	CODE

i	CODE
did	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
scan	CODE
over	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE

on	CODE
our	CODE

about	CODE

did	CODE
an	CODE

hope	CODE
this	CODE
satisfies	CODE
your	CODE
curiosity	CODE
it's	CODE
an	CODE
interesting	CODE
and	CODE
imho	CODE
under-studied	CODE
area	CODE
of	CODE
programming	CODE
you	CODE
know	CODE
when	CODE
jeff	CODE

talking	CODE
about	CODE

a	CODE

at	CODE
them	CODE
hey	CODE

that	CODE
high-level	CODE

what	CODE
you	CODE

httpsourcewinehqorgsourcedllsntdlltimec#l448	CODE
no	CODE
it	CODE
can't	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
since	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
express	CODE
constant	CODE
over	CODE

for	CODE
a	CODE
value	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
guarantee	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
returning	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
is	CODE
constant	CODE
and	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
duration	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
won't	CODE
change	CODE
but	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
you're	CODE
free	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
new	CODE
rows	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE

as	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE

thus	CODE
it's	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
that	CODE
guarantee	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
done	CODE
it	CODE
so	CODE
in	CODE
short	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
optimization	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
end-index	CODE

anything	CODE
other	CODE

a	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE

of	CODE
a	CODE

where	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
loop-code	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
particular	CODE
variable	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
changed	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
and	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE

before	CODE
starting	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
but	CODE
any	CODE
performance	CODE
gain	CODE
from	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
most	CODE
likely	CODE
be	CODE
negligible	CODE
unless	CODE
your	CODE

conclusion	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE

you	CODE

for	CODE
your	CODE

answer	CODE

no	CODE
javascript	CODE

nope	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE

a	CODE
class	CODE
approach	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
final	CODE
level	CODE
and	CODE
real	CODE
properties	CODE
or	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
names	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
properties	CODE
changing	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
from	CODE
node	CODE
to	CODE
node	CODE
i'd	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
what	CODE
efficient	CODE
means	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
speed	CODE
of	CODE
updates	CODE
insert	CODE
update	CODE
delete	CODE
speed	CODE
of	CODE
random	CODE
access	CODE
retrieval	CODE
speed	CODE
of	CODE
sequential	CODE
retrieval	CODE
memory	CODE
used	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
you'll	CODE
find	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
speedy	CODE
will	CODE
generally	CODE
consume	CODE
more	CODE
memory	CODE
than	CODE
one	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
slow	CODE
this	CODE
isn't	CODE
always	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
but	CODE
most	CODE
data	CODE
structures	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
follow	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
and	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
relatively	CODE
uniformly	CODE
fast	CODE
access	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
most	CODE
likely	CODE
use	CODE
more	CODE
memory	CODE
than	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
suggest	CODE
lists	CODE
lists	CODE
however	CODE
generally	CODE
tend	CODE
to	CODE
contain	CODE
more	CODE
overhead	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
insert	CODE
data	CODE
into	CODE
it	CODE
unless	CODE
they	CODE
preallocate	CODE
x	CODE
nodes	CODE
in	CODE
which	CODE
they	CODE
will	CODE
again	CODE
use	CODE
more	CODE
memory	CODE
my	CODE
suggestion	CODE
in	CODE
general	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
that	CODE
seems	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
natural	CODE
to	CODE
you	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
stress	CODE
test	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
substantial	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
becomes	CODE
a	CODE
problem	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
also	CODE
consider	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
layer	CODE
of	CODE
abstraction	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
system	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
programming	CODE
interface	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
later	CODE
on	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
internal	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
making	CODE
a	CODE
class-based	CODE
structure	CODE
would	CODE
probably	CODE
have	CODE
more	CODE
overhead	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
dict-based	CODE
structure	CODE
since	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
classes	CODE
actually	CODE
use	CODE
dicts	CODE
when	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
implemented	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
understand	CODE
it	CODE
random	CODE
access	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
constant	CODE
time	CODE
for	CODE
both	CODE
python's	CODE
dicts	CODE
and	CODE
lists	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
only	CODE
do	CODE
random	CODE
access	CODE
of	CODE
integer	CODE
indexes	CODE
with	CODE
lists	CODE
i'm	CODE
assuming	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
lookup	CODE
a	CODE
node	CODE
by	CODE
its	CODE
label	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
a	CODE
dict	CODE
of	CODE
dicts	CODE
however	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
performance	CODE
front	CODE
loading	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
memory	CODE
may	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
problem	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
you'll	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
swapping	CODE
to	CODE
disk	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
kill	CODE
the	CODE
performance	CODE
of	CODE
even	CODE
python's	CODE
highly	CODE
efficient	CODE
dicts	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
keep	CODE
memory	CODE
usage	CODE
down	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
as	CODE
possible	CODE
also	CODE
ram	CODE
is	CODE
amazingly	CODE
cheap	CODE
right	CODE
now	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
thing	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
there's	CODE
no	CODE
reason	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE

4gb	CODE
if	CODE
you'd	CODE
like	CODE
advice	CODE
on	CODE

learn	CODE

there	CODE

don't	CODE

any	CODE

with	CODE
your	CODE

just	CODE
out	CODE

my	CODE

what	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
manually	CODE
does	CODE
it	CODE
work	CODE
also	CODE
try	CODE
then	CODE
use	CODE

of	CODE
reading	CODE

see	CODE
whether	CODE
you	CODE
still	CODE
get	CODE
accessviolation	CODE

i	CODE
had	CODE
no	CODE
luck	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
guess	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE

that	CODE
matches	CODE
the	CODE

of	CODE
the	CODE

that	CODE
makes	CODE

binaryformatter	CODE
has	CODE
its	CODE
own	CODE

format	CODE
completely	CODE

i	CODE
had	CODE
no	CODE

i	CODE
realised	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
i	CODE
wasn't	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
very	CODE
much	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
content	CODE
anyway	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
went	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
of	CODE
reading	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
stream	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
bytebuffer	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
converting	CODE
it	CODE
using	CODE
for	CODE
strings	CODE
and	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
integers	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
more	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
later	CODE
on	CODE
but	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
version	CODE
i	CODE
got	CODE
away	CODE
with	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
lines	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
google	CODE

can	CODE

really	CODE
nice	CODE
looking	CODE

it's	CODE
a	CODE

here	CODE
it	CODE

the	CODE

works	CODE
in	CODE
all	CODE
modern	CODE
browsers	CODE
when	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE

ajax	CODE
-	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE

work	CODE
better	CODE

regardless	CODE
of	CODE

while	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
still	CODE
like	CODE
an	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
why	CODE
my	CODE
js	CODE
wasn't	CODE
being	CODE
recognized	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
i	CODE
found	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
meantime	CODE
and	CODE
should	CODE
have	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
place	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
aspcomparevalidator	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
aspcustomvalidator	CODE
while	CODE
you	CODE
cannot	CODE
prevent	CODE
usage	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
inherited	CODE
members	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
knowledge	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
hide	CODE
them	CODE
from	CODE
intellisense	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
editorbrowsableattribute	CODE
edit	CODE
just	CODE
saw	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
documentation	CODE
comments	CODE
which	CODE
makes	CODE
it	CODE
kinda	CODE
useless	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
purpose	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
prominent	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
states	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
attribute	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
suppress	CODE
members	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
assembly	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
true	CODE
but	CODE
not	CODE
complete	CODE
actually	CODE
the	CODE
attribute	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
suppress	CODE
members	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
solution	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you're	CODE
best	CODE
least	CODE
hackish	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
consider	CODE
composition	CODE
as	CODE
opposed	CODE
to	CODE
inheritance	CODE
or	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
create	CODE
an	CODE
interface	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
members	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
have	CODE
your	CODE
derived	CODE
class	CODE
implement	CODE
that	CODE
interface	CODE
and	CODE
program	CODE
against	CODE
the	CODE
interface	CODE
one	CODE
potential	CODE
thing	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
contain	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
extend	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
class	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
flexibility	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
exposing	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
expose	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
absolutely	CODE
need	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
type	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
ideal	CODE
solution	CODE
however	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
expose	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
getter	CODE
thus	CODE
becomes	CODE
or	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
thinking	CODE
off	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
head	CODE
here	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
load	CODE
both	CODE
as	CODE
data	CODE
tables	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
data	CODE
sets	CODE
and	CODE
define	CODE
a	CODE
relation	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
over	CODE
sku	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
run	CODE
a	CODE
query	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
set	CODE
which	CODE
produces	CODE
the	CODE
desired	CODE
result	CODE
as	CODE
long	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
databases	CODE
are	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
physical	CODE
server	CODE
assuming	CODE
mssql	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
usernamepassword	CODE
being	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
connection	CODE
string	CODE
has	CODE
rights	CODE
to	CODE
both	CODE
dbs	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
perform	CODE
a	CODE
join	CODE
across	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
databases	CODE
example	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
domain	CODE
object	CODE
based	CODE
approach	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
problem	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
million	CODE
variations	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
once	CODE
you	CODE
aggregate	CODE
this	CODE
information	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
it	CODE
be	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
present	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
sqlite	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
support	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
sql	CODE
queries	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
out	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
docs	CODE
for	CODE
sqlite3	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
sqlite	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
an	CODE
array	CODE
of	CODE
dicts	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
add	CODE
metadata	CODE
to	CODE
any	CODE
record	CODE
and	CODE
search	CODE
it	CODE
very	CODE
easily	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
several	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
common	CODE
methods	CODE
use	CODE
recursion	CODE
memoization	CODE
or	CODE
dynamic	CODE
programming	CODE
the	CODE
basic	CODE
idea	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
produce	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
all	CODE
strings	CODE
of	CODE
length	CODE
1	CODE
then	CODE
in	CODE
each	CODE
iteration	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
strings	CODE
produced	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
iteration	CODE
add	CODE
that	CODE
string	CODE
concatenated	CODE
with	CODE
each	CODE
character	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
individually	CODE
the	CODE
variable	CODE
index	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
below	CODE
keeps	CODE
track	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
start	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
iteration	CODE
some	CODE
pseudocode	CODE
you'd	CODE
then	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
remove	CODE
all	CODE
strings	CODE
less	CODE
than	CODE
x	CODE
in	CODE
length	CODE
they'll	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE

*	CODE

entries	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
whipped	CODE
this	CODE
up	CODE
quick	CODE
in	CODE
ruby	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
language	CODE
api	CODE
for	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
permutation	CODE
type	CODE
functions	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
more	CODE

code	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE

are	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
high	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE

there	CODE
is	CODE

of	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
around	CODE
having	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
results	CODE
anyways	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
behind	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
start	CODE
with	CODE
string	CODE
of	CODE
length	CODE
0	CODE
then	CODE
keep	CODE
track	CODE
of	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
strings	CODE
of	CODE
length	CODE
z	CODE
where	CODE
z	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
size	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
iteration	CODE
then	CODE
go	CODE
through	CODE
each	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
append	CODE
each	CODE
character	CODE
onto	CODE
each	CODE
string	CODE
finally	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
remove	CODE
any	CODE
that	CODE
were	CODE
below	CODE
the	CODE
x	CODE
threshold	CODE
and	CODE
return	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
i	CODE
didn't	CODE
test	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
potentially	CODE
meaningless	CODE
input	CODE
null	CODE
character	CODE
list	CODE
weird	CODE
values	CODE
of	CODE
x	CODE
and	CODE
y	CODE
etc	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
why	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
place	CODE
the	CODE
resulting	CODE
set	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
moderately	CODE
large	CODE
values	CODE
of	CODE
x	CODE
and	CODE
y	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
huge	CODE
and	CODE
will	CODE
grow	CODE
exponentially	CODE
as	CODE
x	CODE
andor	CODE
y	CODE
get	CODE
bigger	CODE
lets	CODE
say	CODE
your	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
possible	CODE
characters	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
26	CODE
lowercase	CODE
letters	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
alphabet	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
ask	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
all	CODE
permutations	CODE
where	CODE
length	CODE
=	CODE
5	CODE
assuming	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
run	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
memory	CODE
you'll	CODE
get	CODE
11881376	CODE
ie	CODE
26	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
power	CODE
of	CODE
5	CODE
strings	CODE
back	CODE
bump	CODE
that	CODE
length	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
6	CODE
and	CODE
you'll	CODE
get	CODE
308915776	CODE
strings	CODE
back	CODE
these	CODE
numbers	CODE
get	CODE
painfully	CODE
large	CODE
very	CODE
quickly	CODE
here's	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
i	CODE
put	CODE
together	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
you'll	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
provide	CODE
two	CODE
runtime	CODE
arguments	CODE
corresponding	CODE
to	CODE
x	CODE
and	CODE
y	CODE
have	CODE
fun	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
strings	CODE
that's	CODE
for	CODE
sure	CODE
where	CODE
x	CODE
and	CODE
y	CODE
is	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE
define	CODE
them	CODE
and	CODE
r	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
characters	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
selecting	CODE
from	CODE
--if	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
understanding	CODE
you	CODE
correctly	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
definitely	CODE
generate	CODE
these	CODE
as	CODE
needed	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
get	CODE
sloppy	CODE
and	CODE
say	CODE
generate	CODE
a	CODE
powerset	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
filter	CODE
the	CODE
length	CODE
of	CODE
strings	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
definitely	CODE
isn't	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
these	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
an	CODE
interesting	CODE
aside	CODE
none-the-less	CODE
knuth	CODE
volume	CODE
4	CODE
fascicle	CODE
2	CODE
7213	CODE
tells	CODE
us	CODE
that	CODE
st-combination	CODE
is	CODE
equivalent	CODE
to	CODE
s+1	CODE
things	CODE
taken	CODE
t	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
time	CODE
with	CODE
repetition	CODE
--	CODE
an	CODE
st-combination	CODE
is	CODE
notation	CODE
used	CODE
by	CODE
knuth	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
equal	CODE
to	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
figure	CODE
this	CODE
out	CODE
by	CODE
first	CODE
generating	CODE
each	CODE
st-combination	CODE
in	CODE
binary	CODE
form	CODE
so	CODE
of	CODE
length	CODE
s+t	CODE
and	CODE
counting	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE

to	CODE
the	CODE
left	CODE
of	CODE
each	CODE

--	CODE
becomes	CODE
the	CODE
permutation	CODE
{0	CODE
3	CODE
4	CODE
4	CODE
4	CODE
1}	CODE
first	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
some	CODE
gui	CODE
library	CODE
with	CODE
python	CODE
bindings	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
some	CODE
program	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
convert	CODE
your	CODE
python	CODE
scripts	CODE
into	CODE
standalone	CODE
executables	CODE
cross-platform	CODE
gui	CODE
libraries	CODE
with	CODE
python	CODE
bindings	CODE
windows	CODE
linux	CODE
mac	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
many	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
popular	CODE
that	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
in	CODE
wild	CODE
are	CODE
tkinter	CODE

very	CODE
popular	CODE
free	CODE
for	CODE
commercial	CODE
projects	CODE
pyqt	CODE
-	CODE
based	CODE

also	CODE
very	CODE
popular	CODE
and	CODE
more	CODE

than	CODE

costly	CODE

complete	CODE
list	CODE
is	CODE
at	CODE
httpwikipythonorgmoinguiprogramming	CODE
single	CODE

py2exe	CODE
-	CODE
probably	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
popular	CODE
out	CODE
there	CODE
pyinstaller	CODE
is	CODE
also	CODE
gaining	CODE
in	CODE
popularity	CODE
single	CODE

the	CODE

single	CODE

mac	CODE
py2app	CODE
-	CODE
again	CODE
works	CODE
like	CODE
py2exe	CODE
but	CODE
targets	CODE

you	CODE
don't	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
compile	CODE
python	CODE
for	CODE
macwindowslinux	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
interpreted	CODE
language	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
simply	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
interpreter	CODE
installed	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
choice	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
available	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
three	CODE
platforms	CODE
as	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
gui	CODE
library	CODE
that	CODE
works	CODE
cross	CODE
platform	CODE
python's	CODE
tktcl	CODE
widget	CODE
library	CODE
works	CODE
very	CODE
well	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
is	CODE
sufficiently	CODE
cross	CODE
platform	CODE
tkinter	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
interface	CODE
to	CODE
tktcl	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE

tkinter	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
guiprogramming	CODE
toolkit	CODE
for	CODE
python	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
however	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
commonly	CODE
used	CODE
one	CODE
and	CODE
almost	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
one	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
portable	CODE
between	CODE
unix	CODE
mac	CODE

windows	CODE
since	CODE
python	CODE
is	CODE
installed	CODE
on	CODE
nearly	CODE
every	CODE
non-windows	CODE
os	CODE
by	CODE
default	CODE
now	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
thing	CODE
you	CODE
really	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
of	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
non-standard	CODE
libraries	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
are	CODE
installed	CODE
having	CODE
said	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
executables	CODE
that	CODE
include	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
interpreter	CODE
and	CODE
any	CODE
libraries	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
likely	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
large	CODE
executable	CODE
however	CODE
macos	CODE
x	CODE
even	CODE
includes	CODE
support	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
xcode	CODE
ide	CODE
for	CODE
creating	CODE
full	CODE
standalone	CODE
gui	CODE
apps	CODE
these	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
run	CODE
by	CODE
any	CODE
user	CODE
running	CODE
os	CODE
x	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
php	CODE
dev	CODE
but	CODE
google	CODE
says	CODE
that	CODE
php	CODE
5+	CODE
can	CODE
instantiate	CODE
com	CODE
components	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
install	CODE
outlook	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
box	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
php	CODE
web	CODE
service	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
com	CODE
component	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
requests	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
outlook	CODE
api	CODE
referance	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
not	CODE
used	CODE
php	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
have	CODE
experience	CODE
in	CODE
using	CODE
c#	CODE
to	CODE
achieve	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
thing	CODE
the	CODE
outlook	CODE
api	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
automating	CODE
outlook	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
connecting	CODE
to	CODE
exchange	CODE
directly	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
previously	CODE
taken	CODE
this	CODE
approach	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
does	CODE
work	CODE
although	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
buggy	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
wish	CODE
to	CODE
connect	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
exchange	CODE
server	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
research	CODE
extended	CODE
mapi	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
i	CODE
used	CODE
this	CODE
wrapper	CODE
mapiex	CODE
extended	CODE
mapi	CODE
wrapper	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
project	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
some	CODE
net	CODE
code	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
php5	CODE
windows	CODE
server	CODE
alternatively	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
c++	CODE
core	CODE
dll	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
found	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
very	CODE
good	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
some	CODE
good	CODE
example	CODE
applications	CODE
update	CODE
sorry	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
delay	CODE
no	CODE
current	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
keep	CODE
track	CODE
of	CODE
posts	CODE
yet	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
agree	CODE
adding	CODE
more	CODE
layer	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
and	CODE
relying	CODE
on	CODE
3rd	CODE
party	CODE
code	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
scary	CODE
and	CODE
rightfully	CODE
so	CODE
today	CODE
i	CODE
read	CODE
another	CODE
interesting	CODE
post	CODE
tagged	CODE
up	CODE
as	CODE
mapi	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
different	CODE
subject	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
thing	CODE
here	CODE
though	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
linked	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
important	CODE
ms	CODE
article	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
unaware	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
issues	CODE
until	CODE
now	CODE
on	CODE
using	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
interface	CODE
to	CODE
mapi	CODE
although	CODE
the	CODE
c++	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
component	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
unaffected	CODE
by	CODE
this	CODE
error	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
unmanaged	CODE
this	CODE
blog	CODE
entry	CODE
also	CODE
suggests	CODE
other	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
connect	CODE
to	CODE
mapiexchange	CODE
server	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
these	CODE
new	CODE
facts	CODE
httpus3phpnetimap	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
as	CODE
suggested	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
user	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
look	CODE
into	CODE
imap	CODE
imap	CODE
pop3	CODE
and	CODE
nntp	CODE
is	CODE
your	CODE
customer	CODE
using	CODE
exchange	CODE
2007	CODE
if	CODE
so	CODE
i'd	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
exchange	CODE
web	CODE
services	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
as	CODE
hairy	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
webdav	CODE
is	CODE
your	CODE
best	CODE
bet	CODE
personally	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
like	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
outlookapplication	CODE
com	CODE
object	CODE
route	CODE
as	CODE
its	CODE
security	CODE
prompts	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
your	CODE
contacts	CODE
allow	CODE
this	CODE
etc	CODE
can	CODE
cause	CODE
problems	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
server	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
difficult	CODE
to	CODE
accomplish	CODE
your	CODE
impersonation-like	CODE
tasks	CODE
using	CODE
outlook	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
sending	CODE
mail	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
user	CODE
in	CODE
general	CODE
css	CODE
properties	CODE
are	CODE
converted	CODE
to	CODE
javascript	CODE
by	CODE
making	CODE
them	CODE
camelcase	CODE
without	CODE
any	CODE
dashes	CODE
so	CODE
background-color	CODE
becomes	CODE
backgroundcolor	CODE
or	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
jquery	CODE
this	CODE
warning	CODE
is	CODE
there	CODE
because	CODE
java	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
actually	CODE
storing	CODE
type	CODE
information	CODE
at	CODE
run-time	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
uses	CODE
generics	CODE
thus	CODE
if	CODE
object	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
a	CODE
liststring	CODE
there	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
no	CODE
classcastexception	CODE
at	CODE
run-time	CODE
except	CODE
until	CODE
an	CODE
item	CODE
is	CODE
accessed	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
match	CODE
the	CODE
generic	CODE
type	CODE
defined	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
variable	CODE
this	CODE
can	CODE
cause	CODE
further	CODE
complications	CODE
if	CODE
items	CODE
are	CODE
added	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
incorrect	CODE
generic	CODE
type	CODE
information	CODE
any	CODE
code	CODE
still	CODE
holding	CODE
a	CODE
reference	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
but	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
generic	CODE
type	CODE
information	CODE
will	CODE
now	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
inconsistent	CODE
list	CODE
to	CODE
remove	CODE
the	CODE
warning	CODE
try	CODE
however	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
certain	CODE
methods	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
add	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
doesn't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
of	CODE
incorrect	CODE
type	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
situations	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
add	CODE
or	CODE
some	CODE
similarly	CODE
restricted	CODE
method	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
just	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
suffer	CODE
the	CODE
yellow	CODE
underline	CODE
in	CODE
eclipse	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
suppresswarning	CODE
annotation	CODE
try	CODE
removing	CODE
the	CODE
0x	CODE
first	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
encodingutf8getstring	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
may	CODE
work	CODE
essentially	CODE
0x44004500	CODE
remove	CODE
the	CODE
0x	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
always	CODE
two	CODE
bytes	CODE
are	CODE
one	CODE
character	CODE
so	CODE
it's	CODE
definitely	CODE
a	CODE
unicodeutf	CODE
format	CODE
with	CODE
two	CODE
bytescharacter	CODE
hazzah	CODE
i	CODE
went	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
michael's	CODE
post	CODE
did	CODE
some	CODE
more	CODE
poking	CODE
and	CODE
realized	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
double	CODE
conversion	CODE
and	CODE
eventually	CODE
worked	CODE
out	CODE
this	CODE
little	CODE
nugget	CODE
from	CODE
there	CODE
i	CODE
simply	CODE
made	CODE
a	CODE
loop	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
through	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
characters	CODE
2	CODE
by	CODE
2	CODE
and	CODE
get	CODE
them	CODE
hexified	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
translated	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
to	CODE
nick	CODE
and	CODE
anybody	CODE
else	CODE
interested	CODE
i	CODE
went	CODE
ahead	CODE
and	CODE
posted	CODE
my	CODE
little	CODE
application	CODE
over	CODE
in	CODE
codeplex	CODE
feel	CODE
free	CODE
to	CODE
usemodify	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
tempdata	CODE
property	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
desired	CODE
request	CODE
components	CODE
for	CODE
instance	CODE
then	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
form	CODE
action	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
go	CODE
keep	CODE
in	CODE
mind	CODE
that	CODE
tempdata	CODE
stores	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
collection	CODE
in	CODE
session	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
behavior	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
implement	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
itempdataprovider	CODE
interface	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
mechanism	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
temp	CODE
data	CODE
i	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
do	CODE
that	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
know	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
fact	CODE
via	CODE
measurement	CODE
and	CODE
profiling	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
session	CODE
state	CODE
is	CODE
hurting	CODE
you	CODE
not	CODE
java	CODE
per-se	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
run	CODE
into	CODE
issues	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
written	CODE
something	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
hasn't	CODE
been	CODE
actually	CODE
written	CODE
yet	CODE
-	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
cache	CODE
somewhere	CODE
and	CODE
reading	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
file	CODE
may	CODE
not	CODE
actually	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
information	CODE
short	CODE
version	CODE
-	CODE
use	CODE
flush	CODE
or	CODE
whatever	CODE
the	CODE
relevant	CODE
system	CODE
call	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
ensure	CODE
that	CODE
your	CODE

that	CODE
your	CODE

unfortunately	CODE

on	CODE
theoretical	CODE
principles	CODE

even	CODE
though	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
safe	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
case	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
allowed	CODE
it	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE

for	CODE
all	CODE
cases	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
words	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
isn't	CODE
stopping	CODE
just	CODE
you	CODE
it's	CODE
stopping	CODE
everyone	CODE
including	CODE
all	CODE
those	CODE
that	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
unsafe	CODE
and	CODE
needs	CODE
special	CODE
handling	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
probably	CODE
other	CODE
reasons	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
all	CODE
languages	CODE
usually	CODE
have	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
unsafe	CODE
things	CODE
if	CODE
one	CODE
knows	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
them	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
net	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
similar	CODE
provisions	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
declare	CODE
a	CODE
constructor	CODE
that	CODE
calls	CODE
a	CODE
base	CODE
constructor	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
doing	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
base	CODE
constructor	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
called	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
body	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
cannot	CODE
change	CODE
this	CODE
order	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
java	CODE
is	CODE
implemented	CODE
internally	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
superclass	CODE
throws	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
then	CODE
there	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
instance	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
you	CODE
extend	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
impossible	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
tostring	CODE
or	CODE
equals	CODE
methods	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
since	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
inherited	CODE
in	CODE
most	CODE
cases	CODE
java	CODE
may	CODE
allow	CODE
a	CODE
trycatch	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
super	CODE
call	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
if	CODE
1	CODE
you	CODE
override	CODE
all	CODE
methods	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
superclasses	CODE
and	CODE
2	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
superxxx	CODE
clause	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
all	CODE
sounds	CODE
too	CODE
complicated	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
presume	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
deep	CODE
understanding	CODE
of	CODE
java	CODE
internals	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
my	CODE
understanding	CODE
that	CODE
when	CODE
a	CODE
compiler	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
instantiate	CODE
a	CODE
derived	CODE
class	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
first	CODE
create	CODE
the	CODE
base	CODE
and	CODE
its	CODE
base	CODE
before	CODE
that	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
slap	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
extensions	CODE
made	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
subclass	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
even	CODE
the	CODE
danger	CODE
of	CODE
uninited	CODE
variables	CODE
or	CODE
anything	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
subclass'	CODE
constructor	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
base	CODE
class'	CODE
constructor	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
basically	CODE
asking	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
to	CODE
extend	CODE
a	CODE
base	CODE
object	CODE
instance	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
exist	CODE
yet	CODE
editin	CODE
your	CODE
case	CODE
myclass	CODE
becomes	CODE
the	CODE
base	CODE
object	CODE
and	CODE
myclassmock	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
subclass	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
[123]	CODE
is	CODE
dynamic	CODE
and	CODE
flexible	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
flexibility	CODE
comes	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
speed	CODE
cost	CODE
the	CODE
tuple	CODE
123	CODE
is	CODE
fixed	CODE
immutable	CODE
and	CODE
therefore	CODE
faster	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
faq	CODE
lists	CODE
and	CODE
tuples	CODE
while	CODE
similar	CODE
in	CODE
many	CODE
respects	CODE
are	CODE
generally	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
fundamentally	CODE
different	CODE
ways	CODE
tuples	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
thought	CODE
of	CODE
as	CODE
being	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
pascal	CODE
records	CODE
or	CODE
c	CODE
structs	CODE
they're	CODE
small	CODE
collections	CODE
of	CODE
related	CODE
data	CODE
which	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
of	CODE
different	CODE
types	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
operated	CODE
on	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
group	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
a	CODE
cartesian	CODE
coordinate	CODE
is	CODE
appropriately	CODE
represented	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
tuple	CODE
of	CODE
two	CODE
or	CODE
three	CODE
numbers	CODE
lists	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
hand	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
like	CODE
arrays	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
languages	CODE
they	CODE
tend	CODE
to	CODE
hold	CODE
a	CODE
varying	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
type	CODE
and	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
operated	CODE
on	CODE
one-by-one	CODE
generally	CODE
by	CODE
convention	CODE
you	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
choose	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
tuple	CODE
just	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
its	CODE
immutability	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
choose	CODE
a	CODE
tuple	CODE
for	CODE
small	CODE
collections	CODE
of	CODE
completely	CODE
different	CODE
pieces	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
in	CODE
which	CODE
a	CODE
full-blown	CODE
class	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
too	CODE
heavyweight	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
for	CODE
collections	CODE
of	CODE
any	CODE
reasonable	CODE
size	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
homogeneous	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
tuples	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
quick\flexible	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
composite	CODE
data-types	CODE
lists	CODE
are	CODE
containers	CODE
for	CODE
well	CODE
lists	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
student	CODE
details	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
each	CODE
student	CODE
detail	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
list	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
3-tuple	CODE
containing	CODE
their	CODE
roll	CODE
number	CODE
name	CODE
and	CODE
test	CODE
score	CODE
also	CODE
because	CODE
tuples	CODE
are	CODE
immutable	CODE
they	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
as	CODE
keys	CODE
in	CODE
dictionaries	CODE
as	CODE
others	CODE
have	CODE
mentioned	CODE
lists	CODE
and	CODE
tuples	CODE
are	CODE
both	CODE
containers	CODE
which	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
python	CODE
objects	CODE
lists	CODE
are	CODE
extensible	CODE
and	CODE
their	CODE
contents	CODE
can	CODE
change	CODE
by	CODE
assignment	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
hand	CODE
tuples	CODE
are	CODE
immutable	CODE
also	CODE
lists	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
as	CODE
keys	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
whereas	CODE
tuples	CODE
can	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
that	CODE
works	CODE
with	CODE
tuples	CODE
use	CODE
them	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
forces	CODE
immutability	CODE
which	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
drives	CODE
you	CODE
down	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
functional	CODE
path	CODE
you	CODE
almost	CODE
never	CODE
regret	CODE
going	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
functionalimmutable	CODE
path	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
it	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
iffy	CODE
but	CODE
pretty	CODE
reliable	CODE
way	CODE
basically	CODE
an	CODE
element	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
font	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
element	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
font	CODE
set	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
element	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
exist	CODE
it	CODE
takes	CODE
the	CODE
font	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
parent	CODE
element	CODE
so	CODE
what	CODE
they	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
measure	CODE
the	CODE
width	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
rendered	CODE
string	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
matches	CODE
what	CODE
they	CODE
expected	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
desired	CODE
font	CODE
as	CODE
opposed	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE

this	CODE

an	CODE

oodles	CODE

academic	CODE
papers	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

it's	CODE

you	CODE
looking	CODE

are	CODE
you	CODE
familiar	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
academic	CODE
literature	CODE
text	CODE
detection	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
standard	CODE
problem	CODE
in	CODE
any	CODE
ocr	CODE
optical	CODE
character	CODE
recognition	CODE
system	CODE
and	CODE
consequently	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
lots	CODE
of	CODE
bits	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
interwebs	CODE
that	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
start	CODE
listing	CODE
piles	CODE
of	CODE
links	CODE
from	CODE
google	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
suggest	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
search	CODE
for	CODE
text	CODE
detection	CODE
and	CODE
start	CODE
reading	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
ample	CODE
example	CODE
code	CODE
available	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
recognizing	CODE
text	CODE
inside	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
is	CODE
indeed	CODE
a	CODE
hot	CODE
topic	CODE
for	CODE
researchers	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
field	CODE
but	CODE
only	CODE
begun	CODE
to	CODE
grow	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
control	CODE
when	CODE
captcha's	CODE
became	CODE
the	CODE
norm	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
defense	CODE
against	CODE
spam	CODE
bots	CODE
why	CODE
use	CODE
captcha's	CODE
as	CODE
protection	CODE
well	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
iswas	CODE
very	CODE
hard	CODE
to	CODE
locate	CODE
and	CODE
read	CODE
text	CODE
inside	CODE
an	CODE
image	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
why	CODE
i	CODE
mention	CODE
captcha's	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
advancement*	CODE
is	CODE
made	CODE
within	CODE
that	CODE
tiny	CODE
area	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
your	CODE
solution	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
best	CODE
found	CODE
there	CODE
especially	CODE
because	CODE
captcha's	CODE
are	CODE
indeed	CODE
about	CODE
locating	CODE
text	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
resembles	CODE
text	CODE
inside	CODE
a	CODE
cluttered	CODE
image	CODE
and	CODE
afterwards	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
letters	CODE
correctly	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
yourself	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
open	CODE
source	CODE
captcha	CODE
breaking	CODE
tool	CODE
you	CODE
probably	CODE
have	CODE
all	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
continue	CODE
your	CODE
quest	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
probably	CODE
even	CODE
throw	CODE
away	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
dificult	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
handles	CODE
the	CODE
character	CODE
recognition	CODE
itself	CODE
because	CODE
those	CODE
ocr's	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
distorted	CODE
text	CODE
something	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
*	CODE

in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
visible	CODE
usable	CODE

you're	CODE
looking	CODE

some	CODE

possibly	CODE

none	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
may	CODE
apply	CODE

ruby	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
cases	CODE
that	CODE
really	CODE
boil	CODE
down	CODE

details	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
more	CODE
comfortable	CODE

experienced	CODE
with	CODE
python	CODE
then	CODE
say	CODE
so	CODE
are	CODE
they	CODE
asking	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
justify	CODE
it	CODE
because	CODE
they're	CODE
more	CODE
comfortable	CODE
with	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE

after	CODE

the	CODE

to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE

that	CODE

they	CODE

up-front	CODE
that	CODE
it's	CODE

you	CODE
longer	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
consider	CODE
that	CODE
using	CODE

show	CODE

you	CODE

most	CODE

on	CODE

you're	CODE
practically	CODE
working	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
dsl	CODE
that	CODE
anyone	CODE
who	CODE
uses	CODE
your	CODE
project	CODE
will	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
know	CODE
python	CODE
then	CODE
they	CODE
can	CODE
figure	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
doing	CODE
with	CODE
django	CODE
etc	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
day	CODE
i'm	CODE
only	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
web	CODE
development	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
appears	CODE
that's	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
seeing	CODE
ruby	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
php	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
list	CODE
the	CODE
real	CODE
message	CODE
that's	CODE
important	CODE
is	CODE
applying	CODE
to	CODE
whatever	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
you	CODE
like	CODE
about	CODE
python	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
some	CODE
problem	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
installed	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
machine	CODE
anymore	CODE
and	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
linux	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
remember	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
an	CODE
wizard	CODE
hidden	CODE
somewhere	CODE
inside	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
menus	CODE
that	CODE
gave	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
builder	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
wizard	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
define	CODE
all	CODE
your	CODE
classes'	CODE
details	CODE
including	CODE
methods	CODE
and	CODE
attributes	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
remember	CODE
well	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
an	CODE
option	CODE
through	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
ask	CODE
vs	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
the	CODE
setters	CODE
and	CODE
getters	CODE
automatically	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
it's	CODE
quite	CODE
vague	CODE
but	CODE
check	CODE
it	CODE
out	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
find	CODE
it	CODE
by	CODE
generate	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
mean	CODE
auto-generate	CODE
if	CODE
that's	CODE
not	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
mean	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2008	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
easiest	CODE
implementation	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
background	CODE
this	CODE
creates	CODE
an	CODE
implied	CODE
instance	CODE
variable	CODE
to	CODE
which	CODE
your	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
stored	CODE
and	CODE
retrieved	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
put	CODE
in	CODE
more	CODE
logic	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
properties	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
instance	CODE
variable	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE
previous	CODE
versions	CODE
of	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
always	CODE
used	CODE
this	CODE
longhand	CODE
method	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2005	CODE
and	CODE
up	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
settergetter	CODE
real	CODE
fast	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
insert	CODE
snippet	CODE
command	CODE
right	CODE
click	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
click	CODE
on	CODE
insert	CODE
snippet	CODE
ctrl+kx	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
choose	CODE
prop	CODE
form	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
using	CODE
ctrl+kx	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
also	CODE
just	CODE
type	CODE
prop	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
hit	CODE
tab	CODE
twice	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
also	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
feature	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
generate	CODE
a	CODE
property	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
private	CODE
variable	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
right-click	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
menu	CODE
that	CODE
pops	CODE
up	CODE
click	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
refactor	CODE
item	CODE
then	CODE
choose	CODE
encapsulate	CODE
field	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
gettersetter	CODE
property	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
big	CODE
a	CODE
fan	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
technique	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
bit	CODE
awkward	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
getterssetters	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
puts	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
directly	CODE
below	CODE
the	CODE
private	CODE
field	CODE
which	CODE
bugs	CODE
me	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
usually	CODE
have	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
private	CODE
fields	CODE
grouped	CODE
together	CODE
and	CODE
this	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
feature	CODE
breaks	CODE
my	CODE
class'	CODE
formatting	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
needed	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
client-server	CODE
model	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
clients	CODE
could	CODE
leave	CODE
and	CODE
enter	CODE
whenever	CODE
they	CODE
want	CODE
i	CODE
assume	CODE
that's	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
mobile	CODE
devices	CODE
i	CODE
made	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
clients	CODE
send	CODE
an	CODE
online	CODE
message	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
indicating	CODE
they	CODE
were	CODE
connected	CODE
and	CODE
ready	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
whatever	CODE
they	CODE
needed	CODE
doing	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
time	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
could	CODE
send	CODE
messages	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
trough	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
open	CODE
connection	CODE
also	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
applicable	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
some	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
heartbeat	CODE
the	CODE
clients	CODE
sent	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
letting	CODE
it	CODE
know	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
still	CODE
online	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
knows	CODE
when	CODE
a	CODE
client	CODE
was	CODE
forcibly	CODE
disconnected	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
network	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
could	CODE
mark	CODE
that	CODE
client	CODE
back	CODE
as	CODE
offline	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
clear	CODE
on	CODE
whether	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
you're	CODE
wanting	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
asynchronous	CODE
bits	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
or	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c++	CODE
desktop	CODE
windows	CODE
platforms	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
socket	CODE
io	CODE
asynchronously	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
api's	CODE
that	CODE
use	CODE
overlapped	CODE
io	CODE
for	CODE
sockets	CODE
wsasend	CODE
wsarecv	CODE
both	CODE
allow	CODE
async	CODE
io	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
documentation	CODE
on	CODE
their	CODE
lpoverlapped	CODE
parameters	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
populate	CODE
with	CODE
events	CODE
that	CODE
get	CODE
set	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
io	CODE
completes	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
windows	CODE
mobile	CODE
platforms	CODE
support	CODE
these	CODE
functions	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
some	CODE
additional	CODE
digging	CODE
just	CODE
wondering	CODE
what	CODE
do	CODE
you	CODE
feel	CODE
your	CODE
method	CODE
leaves	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
desired	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
replace	CODE
the	CODE
anonymous	CODE
delegate	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
named	CODE
delegate	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
an	CODE
excellent	CODE
opportunity	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
aspect	CODE
oriented	CODE
programming	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
article	CODE
on	CODE
aop	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
the	CODE
general	CODE
idea	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you'd	CODE
extract	CODE
the	CODE
cross-functional	CODE
concern	CODE
ie	CODE
retry	CODE
for	CODE
x	CODE
hours	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
separate	CODE
class	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
you'd	CODE
annotate	CODE
any	CODE
methods	CODE
that	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
modify	CODE
their	CODE
behaviour	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
here's	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
look	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
on	CODE
int32[retryfor	CODE
10hours	CODE
]	CODE
public	CODE
void	CODE
deletearchive	CODE
{	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
delete	CODE
the	CODE
archive	CODE
}	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
oo	CODE
approach	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
base	CODE
class	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
error	CODE
handling	CODE
and	CODE
calls	CODE
an	CODE
abstract	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
perform	CODE
the	CODE
concrete	CODE
work	CODE
template	CODE
method	CODE
pattern	CODE
create	CODE
concrete	CODE
classes	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
operation	CODE
this	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
advantage	CODE
of	CODE
naming	CODE
each	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
operation	CODE
you	CODE
perform	CODE
and	CODE
gives	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
command	CODE
pattern	CODE
-	CODE
operations	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
represented	CODE
as	CODE
objects	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
unittest++	CODE
while	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
tutorial	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2005	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
are	CODE
similar	CODE
try	CODE
setting	CODE
one	CODE
up	CODE
for	CODE
vc6	CODE
update	CODE
the	CODE
vc6	CODE
hacks	CODE
are	CODE
now	CODE
included	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
i've	CODE
worked	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
san	CODE
system	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
with	CODE
telephony	CODE
audio	CODE
recordings	CODE
which	CODE
had	CODE
issues	CODE
with	CODE
numbers	CODE
of	CODE
files	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
folder	CODE
-	CODE
that	CODE
system	CODE
became	CODE
unusable	CODE
somewhere	CODE
near	CODE
5000	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
2000	CODE
advanced	CODE
server	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
in	CODE
c#net	CODE
11-	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
sensible	CODE
solution	CODE
that	CODE
we	CODE
came	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
was	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
the	CODE
folder	CODE
structure	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
were	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
reasonable	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
files	CODE
interestingly	CODE
explorer	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
time	CODE
out	CODE
the	CODE
convention	CODE
we	CODE
came	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
was	CODE
a	CODE
structure	CODE
that	CODE
broke	CODE
the	CODE
structure	CODE
up	CODE
in	CODE
years	CODE
months	CODE
and	CODE
days	CODE
-	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
depend	CODE
upon	CODE
your	CODE
system	CODE
and	CODE
whether	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
control	CODE
the	CODE
directory	CODE
structure	CODE
none	CODE
net	CODE
relies	CODE
on	CODE
underlying	CODE
windows	CODE
api	CODE
calls	CODE
that	CODE
really	CODE
really	CODE
hate	CODE
that	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
files	CODE
themselves	CODE
as	CODE
ronnie	CODE
says	CODE
split	CODE
them	CODE
up	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
dos	CODE
definitely	CODE
split	CODE
them	CODE
up	CODE
that	CODE
said	CODE
stay	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
away	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
indexing	CODE
service	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
either	CODE
indexing	CODE
the	CODE
files	CODE
yourself	CODE
or	CODE
getting	CODE
a	CODE
third	CODE
part	CODE
app	CODE
like	CODE
google	CODE
desktop	CODE
or	CODE
copernic	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
interface	CODE
with	CODE
their	CODE
index	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
copernic	CODE
has	CODE
an	CODE
api	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
search	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
their	CODE
index	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
also	CODE
supports	CODE
mapping	CODE
network	CODE
drives	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
example	CODE
will	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
after	CODE
creating	CODE
it	CODE
edit	CODE
this	CODE
isn't	CODE
really	CODE
true	CODE
@lance	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
one	CODE
is	CODE
also	CODE
executing	CODE
compare	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
named	CODE
constructor	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
also	CODE
executing	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
goes	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
anonymous	CODE
constructor	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
was	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
-	CODE
both	CODE
cases	CODE
will	CODE
execute	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
real	CODE
difference	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
expression	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
and	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
basically	CODE
behaviour	CODE
of	CODE
is	CODE
effectively	CODE
equivalent	CODE
to	CODE
although	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
tempobject	CODE
and	CODE
result	CODE
are	CODE
transient	CODE
values	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
never	CODE
see	CODE
they're	CODE
implementation	CODE
details	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
interpreter	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
js	CODE
mechanism	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
check	CODE
broadly	CODE
speaking	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
function	CODE
{	CODE
}	CODE
method	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
slower	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
the	CODE
this	CODE
object	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
that	CODE
said	CODE
this	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
difference	CODE
as	CODE
object	CODE
allocation	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
slow	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
be	CODE
using	CODE
such	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
hot	CODE
code	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
cost	CODE
of	CODE
creating	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
object	CODE
and	CODE
associated	CODE
closure	CODE
edit	CODE
one	CODE
thing	CODE
i	CODE
realised	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
missed	CODE
from	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
tempobject	CODE
will	CODE
get	CODE
expressions	CODE
prototype	CODE
eg	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
expressioncall	CODE
tempobject__proto__	CODE
=	CODE
expressionprototype	CODE
well	CODE
i	CODE
made	CODE
a	CODE
page	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
surprisingly	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
anyway	CODE
it	CODE
alerted	CODE
both	CODE
method	CODE
1	CODE
and	CODE
method	CODE
2	CODE
i	CODE
didn't	CODE
expect	CODE
method	CODE
1	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
alerted	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
was	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
values	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
and	CODE
b	CODE
were	CODE
a	CODE
was	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
itself	CODE
while	CODE
b	CODE
was	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
returned	CODE
yes	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
differences	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
both	CODE
are	CODE
anonymous	CODE
functions	CODE
and	CODE
execute	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
exact	CODE
same	CODE
way	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
case	CODE
scope	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
variables	CODE
is	CODE
restricted	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
anonymous	CODE
function	CODE
itself	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
chance	CODE
of	CODE
accidentally	CODE
adding	CODE
variables	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
global	CODE
scope	CODE
this	CODE
implies	CODE
that	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
method	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
cluttering	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
global	CODE
variables	CODE
scope	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
as	CODE
these	CODE
global	CODE
variable	CODE
values	CODE
can	CODE
interfere	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
global	CODE
variables	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
use	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
library	CODE
or	CODE
are	CODE
being	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
third	CODE
party	CODE
library	CODE
example	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
output	CODE
is	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
hello	CODE
inside	CODE
function	CODE
hello	CODE
outside	CODE
function	CODE
world	CODE
inside	CODE
function	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
an	CODE
error	CODE
as	CODE
'b'	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
defined	CODE
outside	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
thus	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
safer	CODE
they	CODE
both	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
closure	CODE
by	CODE
executing	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
block	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
matter	CODE
of	CODE
style	CODE
i	CODE
much	CODE
prefer	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
reasons	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
immediately	CODE
obvious	CODE
by	CODE
glancing	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
will	CODE
actually	CODE
be	CODE
executed	CODE
the	CODE
line	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
function	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
executing	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
constructor	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
not	CODE
what's	CODE
actually	CODE
happening	CODE
avoid	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
doesn't	CODE
do	CODE
what	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
it's	CODE
doing	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
function{	CODE
}	CODE
make	CODE
nice	CODE
bookend	CODE
tokens	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
immediately	CODE
see	CODE
that	CODE
you're	CODE
entering	CODE
and	CODE
leaving	CODE
a	CODE
closure	CODE
scope	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
alerts	CODE
the	CODE
programmer	CODE
reading	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
scope	CODE
change	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
especially	CODE
useful	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
doing	CODE
some	CODE
postprocessing	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
eg	CODE
for	CODE
minification	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
was	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
retrieving	CODE
was	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE

the	CODE
submit	CODE

done	CODE
through	CODE

both	CODE

form	CODE
variables	CODE
and	CODE
get	CODE

specified	CODE
as	CODE

parameters	CODE
typically	CODE
integer	CODE
values	CODE
are	CODE
signed	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
explicitly	CODE
need	CODE
an	CODE
unsigned	CODE
value	CODE
it's	CODE
just	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
used	CODE
i	CODE
may	CODE
not	CODE
agree	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
choice	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
just	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
being	CODE
with	CODE
todays	CODE
typical	CODE
memory	CODE
constraints	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
array	CODE

similar	CODE
data	CODE

needs	CODE
an	CODE
uint32	CODE

you	CODE
should	CODE
consider	CODE
other	CODE

an	CODE

therefore	CODE
restrict	CODE

it	CODE
also	CODE
might	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
with	CODE
simplifying	CODE
things	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
lower	CODE
level	CODE
since	CODE
arraylength	CODE
will	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
be	CODE
added	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE

at	CODE
some	CODE

if	CODE

were	CODE
unsigned	CODE

python	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
chapter	CODE
can't	CODE
vouch	CODE
for	CODE
how	CODE
good	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
though	CODE
personally	CODE
i've	CODE
played	CODE
with	CODE
several	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
built-in	CODE
options	CODE
on	CODE
an	CODE
xml-heavy	CODE
project	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
settled	CODE
on	CODE
pulldom	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
choice	CODE
for	CODE
less	CODE
complex	CODE
documents	CODE
especially	CODE
for	CODE
small	CODE
simple	CODE
stuff	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
event-driven	CODE
theory	CODE
of	CODE
parsing	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
setting	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
slew	CODE
of	CODE
callbacks	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
relatively	CODE
simple	CODE
structure	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
quick	CODE
discussion	CODE
of	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
parsing	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
for	CODE
loop	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
using	CODE
callbacks	CODE
you	CODE
also	CODE
delay	CODE
full	CODE
parsing	CODE
the	CODE
pull	CODE
part	CODE
and	CODE
only	CODE
get	CODE
additional	CODE
detail	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
call	CODE
expandnode	CODE
this	CODE
satisfies	CODE
my	CODE
general	CODE
requirement	CODE
for	CODE
responsible	CODE
efficiency	CODE
without	CODE
sacrificing	CODE
ease	CODE
of	CODE
use	CODE
and	CODE
simplicity	CODE
elementtree	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
pythony	CODE
api	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it's	CODE
even	CODE
shipped	CODE
as	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
python	CODE
25	CODE
it's	CODE
in	CODE
pure	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
say	CODE
pretty	CODE
nice	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
wind	CODE
up	CODE
needing	CODE
more	CODE
performance	CODE
then	CODE
lxml	CODE
exposes	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
api	CODE
and	CODE
uses	CODE
libxml2	CODE
under	CODE
the	CODE
hood	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
theoretically	CODE
just	CODE
swap	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
discover	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
it	CODE
since	CODE
you	CODE
mentioned	CODE
that	CODE
you'll	CODE
be	CODE
building	CODE
fairly	CODE
simple	CODE
xml	CODE
the	CODE
minidom	CODE
module	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
standard	CODE
library	CODE
will	CODE
likely	CODE
suit	CODE
your	CODE
needs	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
experience	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
dom	CODE
representation	CODE
of	CODE
xml	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
quite	CODE
straight	CODE
forward	CODE
i	CODE
write	CODE
a	CODE
soap	CODE
server	CODE
that	CODE
receives	CODE
xml	CODE
requests	CODE
and	CODE
creates	CODE
xml	CODE
responses	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
my	CODE
project	CODE
so	CODE
it's	CODE
closed	CODE
source	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
another	CODE
problem	CODE
it	CODE
turned	CODE
out	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
that	CODE
creating	CODE
soap	CODE
xml	CODE
documents	CODE
is	CODE
fairly	CODE
simple	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
that	CODE
fits	CODE
the	CODE
schema	CODE
i	CODE
keep	CODE
the	CODE
envelope	CODE
since	CODE
the	CODE
response	CODE
envelope	CODE
is	CODE
almost	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
request	CODE
envelope	CODE
then	CODE
since	CODE
my	CODE
data	CODE
structure	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
possibly	CODE
nested	CODE
dictionary	CODE
i	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
that	CODE
turns	CODE
this	CODE
dictionary	CODE
into	CODE
key>valuekey>	CODE
items	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
task	CODE
that	CODE
recursion	CODE
makes	CODE
simple	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
structure	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
all	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
currently	CODE
fast	CODE
enough	CODE
for	CODE
production	CODE
use	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
also	CODE
relatively	CODE
easily	CODE
build	CODE
lists	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
although	CODE
depending	CODE
upon	CODE
your	CODE
client	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
hit	CODE
problems	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
give	CODE
length	CODE
hints	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
this	CODE
was	CODE
much	CODE
simpler	CODE
since	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
much	CODE
easier	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
working	CODE
than	CODE
some	CODE
custom	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
books	CODE
generating	CODE
xml	CODE
is	CODE
much	CODE
easier	CODE
than	CODE
parsing	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
reluctant	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
nested	CODE
classes	CODE
here	CODE
what	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
created	CODE
an	CODE
abstract	CODE
base	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
multimedia	CODE
driver	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
back-end	CODE
stuff	CODE
workhorse	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
separate	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
front-end	CODE
work	CODE
the	CODE
front-end	CODE
class	CODE
could	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
pointerreference	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
implemented	CODE
driver	CODE
class	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
appropriate	CODE
media	CODE
type	CODE
and	CODE
situation	CODE
and	CODE
perform	CODE
the	CODE
abstract	CODE
operations	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
workhorse	CODE
structure	CODE
my	CODE
philosophy	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
ahead	CODE
and	CODE
make	CODE
both	CODE
structures	CODE
accessible	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
polished	CODE
way	CODE
just	CODE
under	CODE
the	CODE
assumption	CODE
they	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
tandem	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
reference	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
qtextdocument	CODE
in	CODE
qt	CODE
you	CODE
provide	CODE
a	CODE
direct	CODE
interface	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
bare	CODE
metal	CODE
data	CODE
handling	CODE
but	CODE
pass	CODE
the	CODE
authority	CODE
along	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
qtextedit	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
manipulation	CODE
one	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
deciding	CODE
whether	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
nested	CODE
classes	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
think	CODE
whether	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
this	CODE
class	CODE
plays	CODE
a	CODE
supporting	CODE
role	CODE
or	CODE
it's	CODE
own	CODE
part	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
exists	CODE
solely	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
purpose	CODE
of	CODE
helping	CODE
another	CODE
class	CODE
then	CODE
i	CODE
generally	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
nested	CODE
class	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
load	CODE
of	CODE
caveats	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
seem	CODE
contradictory	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
all	CODE
comes	CODE
down	CODE
to	CODE
experience	CODE
and	CODE
gut-feeling	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
case	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
strategy	CODE
pattern	CODE
assuming	CODE
your	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
was	CODE
named	CODE
mymaster	CODE
edit	CODE
since	CODE
peoplelistview	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
declared	CODE
protected	CODE
by	CODE
default	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
either	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
this	CODE
to	CODE
public	CODE
or	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
public	CODE
property	CODE
wrapper	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
access	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
your	CODE
page	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE
thismasterfindcontrol	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
similar	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
probably	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
-	CODE
it	CODE
requires	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
page	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
structure	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
suggest	CODE
another	CODE
method	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
firing	CODE
an	CODE
event	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
area	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
could	CODE
listen	CODE
for	CODE
and	CODE
re-bind	CODE
when	CODE
fired	CODE
assuming	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
peoplelistview	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
but	CODE
@palmsey	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
correct	CODE
especially	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
page	CODE
could	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
possibility	CODE
of	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
one	CODE
master	CODE
page	CODE
decouple	CODE
them	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
event	CODE
i've	CODE
been	CODE
doing	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
research	CODE
into	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
whilst	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
entirely	CODE
sure	CODE
its	CODE
the	CODE
cause	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
safari	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
returning	CODE
the	CODE
full	CODE
result	CODE
set	CODE
hence	CODE
cropping	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
in	CODE
dicussion	CODE
with	CODE
another	CODE
developer	CODE
and	CODE
found	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
post	CODE
on	CODE
channel	CODE
9	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
which	CODE
recommends	CODE
making	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
sql	CODE
state	CODE
service	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
avoiding	CODE
the	CODE
postback	CODE
issue	CODE
and	CODE
also	CODE
page	CODE
size	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
seem	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
solution	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
port	CODE
of	CODE
call	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
elements	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
which	CODE
controls	CODE
will	CODE
still	CODE
work	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
switch	CODE
viewstate	CODE
off	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
moved	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
and	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
ajax	CODE
call	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
loaded	CODE
when	CODE
required	CODE
failing	CODE
that	CODE
and	CODE
here's	CODE
the	CODE
disclaimer	CODE
-	CODE
i've	CODE
never	CODE
used	CODE
this	CODE
solution	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
web-facing	CODE
site	CODE
-	CODE
but	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
where	CODE
i've	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
eliminate	CODE
massive	CODE
viewstates	CODE
in	CODE
limited-audience	CODE
applications	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
stored	CODE
the	CODE
viewstate	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
session	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
worked	CODE
for	CODE
me	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
hit	CODE
to	CODE
memory	CODE
isn't	CODE
significant	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
users	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
running	CODE
a	CODE
fairly	CODE
popular	CODE
site	CODE
i	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
recommend	CODE
this	CODE
approach	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
session	CODE
solution	CODE
works	CODE
for	CODE
safari	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
always	CODE
detect	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
agent	CODE
and	CODE
fudge	CODE
appropriately	CODE
while	CODE
i	CODE
second	CODE
the	CODE
channel	CODE
9	CODE
solution	CODE
also	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
that	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
hosted	CODE
environments	CODE
safari	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
considered	CODE
an	CODE
up-level	CODE
browser	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
application's	CODE
browscap	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
some	CODE
aspnet	CODE
features	CODE
that	CODE
was	CODE
the	CODE
root	CODE
cause	CODE
of	CODE
some	CODE
headaches	CODE
we	CODE
had	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
client's	CODE
site	CODE
that	CODE
used	CODE
the	CODE
asp	CODE
menu	CODE
control	CODE
without	CODE
the	CODE
extra	CODE
quotes	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
input	CODE
string	CODE
parameter	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
function	CODE
thinks	CODE
i'm	CODE
passing	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
some	CODE
rudimentary	CODE
string	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
force	CODE
javascript	CODE
into	CODE
changing	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
like	CODE
try	CODE
putting	CODE
the	CODE
extra	CODE
text	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
server-side	CODE
script	CODE
block	CODE
and	CODE
concatenating	CODE
edit	CODE
i'm	CODE
pretty	CODE
sure	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
just	CODE
use	CODE
double	CODE
quotes	CODE
outside	CODE
the	CODE
script	CODE
block	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
recently	CODE
similar	CODE
problem	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
plain	CODE
old	CODE
html	CODE
codes	CODE
for	CODE
single	CODE
#39	CODE
and	CODE
double	CODE
quotes	CODE
#34	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
was	CODE
total	CODE
mess	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
worked	CODE
try	CODE
or	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
instead	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
comma	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
thing	CODE
inside	CODE
your	CODE
foreach	CODE
if	CODE
sblength	CODE
0	CODE
sbappend	CODE
how	CODE
about	CODE
tracking	CODE
whether	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
item	CODE
and	CODE
only	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
comma	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
item	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
one	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
linq	CODE
to	CODE
objects	CODE
obviously	CODE
that	CODE
could	CODE
all	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
line	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
clearer	CODE
on	CODE
two	CODE
sorry	CODE
php	CODE
specific	CODE
example	CODE
but	CODE
might	CODE
help	CODE
somebody	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
adding	CODE
the	CODE
comma	CODE
by	CODE
checking	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
container	CODE
is	CODE
empty	CODE
but	CODE
doesn't	CODE
that	CODE
mean	CODE
more	CODE
processing	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
the	CODE
length	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
on	CODE
each	CODE
occurrence	CODE
you're	CODE
prematurely	CODE
optimizing	CODE
the	CODE
performance	CODE
hit	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
negligible	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
make	CODE
an	CODE
array	CODE
of	CODE
cname	CODE
data	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
stringjoin	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
your	CODE
line	CODE
this	CODE
might	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
as	CODE
performant	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
stringbuilder	CODE
approach	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
definitely	CODE
looks	CODE
cleaner	CODE
also	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
consider	CODE
using	CODE
currentculturetextinfolistseparator	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
hard-coded	CODE
comma	CODE
--	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
output	CODE
is	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
imported	CODE
into	CODE
other	CODE
applications	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
have	CODE
problems	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
listseparator	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
different	CODE
across	CODE
different	CODE
cultures	CODE
and	CODE
ms	CODE
excel	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
very	CODE
least	CODE
honors	CODE
this	CODE
setting	CODE
so	CODE
how	CODE
about	CODE
some	CODE
trimming	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
thought	CODE
but	CODE
remember	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
comma's	CODE
and	CODE
quotation	CODE
marks	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
field	CODE
values	CODE
otherwise	CODE
your	CODE
csv	CODE
file	CODE
may	CODE
break	CODE
the	CODE
consumers	CODE
reader	CODE
don't	CODE
forget	CODE
our	CODE
old	CODE
friend	CODE
for	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
as	CODE
nice-looking	CODE
as	CODE
foreach	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
advantage	CODE
of	CODE
being	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
element	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
wrap	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
append	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
if	CODE
that	CODE
tests	CODE
whether	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
property	CODE
contains	CODE
a	CODE
double-quote	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE

so	CODE
escape	CODE
them	CODE
appropriately	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
i'd	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
place	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
future	CODE
ready	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
windows	CODE
presentation	CODE
foundation	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
built	CODE
entirely	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
purpose	CODE
of	CODE
programming	CODE
gui's	CODE
for	CODE
windows	CODE
my	CODE
first	CODE
experience	CODE
writing	CODE
simple	CODE
gui	CODE
applications	CODE
for	CODE
windows	CODE
was	CODE
with	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
the	CODE
gui-building	CODE
interface	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
drag	CODE
and	CODE
drop	CODE
deal	CODE
that	CODE
generates	CODE
skeleton	CODE
methods	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
potential	CODE
user	CODE
actions	CODE
i	CODE
only	CODE
did	CODE
fairly	CODE
basic	CODE
programming	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
imagine	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
an	CODE
excellent	CODE
place	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
the	CODE
basics	CODE
and	CODE
extend	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
more	CODE
advanced	CODE
capabilities	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
go	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
windows	CODE

in	CODE

words	CODE
silverlight	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
the	CODE
ms	CODE
route	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
give	CODE
adobe's	CODE
flashflex	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
see	CODE
both	CODE
silverlight	CODE
and	CODE
flashflex	CODE
build	CODE
ria's	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
is	CODE
where	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
headed	CODE
they	CODE
days	CODE
of	CODE
office	CODE
like	CODE
apps	CODE
are	CODE
numbered	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
rather	CODE
broad	CODE
question	CODE
as	CODE
programming	CODE
gui	CODE
applications	CODE
in	CODE
windows	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE
so	CODE
many	CODE
ways	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
two	CODE
main	CODE
parts	CODE
to	CODE
developing	CODE
any	CODE
gui	CODE
app	CODE
the	CODE
language	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
apiframework	CODE
considering	CODE
you're	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
learning	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
windows	CODE
gui	CODE
apps	CODE
the	CODE
language	CODE
isn't	CODE
really	CODE
a	CODE
point	CODE
of	CODE
focus	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
hence	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
pick	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
you	CODE
already	CODE
know	CODE
and	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
framework	CODE
or	CODE
api	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
harnessed	CODE
by	CODE
your	CODE
chosen	CODE
language	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
c	CODE
you're	CODE
pretty	CODE
much	CODE
restricted	CODE
to	CODE
dealing	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
yourself	CODE
in	CODE
which	CODE
case	CODE
reading	CODE
petzold	CODE
or	CODE
richter	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
great	CODE
places	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
quite	CODE
daunting	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
well	CODE
worth	CODE
the	CODE
effort	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
imho	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
plenty	CODE
of	CODE
tutorials	CODE
on	CODE
win32	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
and	CODE
there's	CODE
always	CODE
msdn	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
complete	CODE
referenceguide	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
you	CODE
cover	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
the	CODE
api	CODE
but	CODE
other	CODE
areas	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
resourcesdialogs	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
building	CODE
blocks	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
win32	CODE
application	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
c++	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
options	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
c	CODE
plus	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
others	CODE
i'd	CODE
recommend	CODE
going	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
directly	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
moving	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
known	CODE
framework	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
mfc	CODE
qt	CODE
wxwindows	CODE
or	CODE
gtk	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
spend	CODE
less	CODE
time	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
boilerplate	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
instead	CODE
focus	CODE
on	CODE
writing	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
logic	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
3	CODE
options	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
listed	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
added	CODE
benefit	CODE
of	CODE
being	CODE
cross-platform	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
worry	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
about	CODE
platform-specific	CODE
issues	CODE
given	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
said	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
windows	CODE
i'll	CODE
assume	CODE
you're	CODE
keen	CODE
to	CODE
focus	CODE
on	CODE
that	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
cross-platform	CODE
--	CODE
so	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
mfc	CODE
but	CODE
spend	CODE
some	CODE
time	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
first	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
familiar	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
when	CODE
dealing	CODE
with	CODE
mfc	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
win32	CODE
api	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
idea	CODE
to	CODE
try	CODE
and	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
solid	CODE
understanding	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
terminology	CODE
prior	CODE
to	CODE
writing	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
understand	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
message	CODE
pump	CODE
is	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
about	CODE
concepts	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
owner-drawn	CODE
controls	CODE
and	CODE
subclassing	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
understand	CODE
these	CODE
things	CODE
and	CODE
more	CODE
you'll	CODE
find	CODE
it	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
mfc	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
uses	CODE
similar	CODE
terminology	CODE
in	CODE
its	CODE
class	CODE
interfaces	CODE
eg	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
what	CODE
translate	CODE
messages	CODE
means	CODE
before	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
understand	CODE
how	CODE
and	CODE
when	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
pretranslatemessage	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
also	CODE
use	CODE
managed	CODE
c++	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
net	CODE
gui	CODE
applications	CODE
but	CODE
i've	CODE
read	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
places	CODE
that	CODE
managed	CODE
c++	CODE
wasn't	CODE
really	CODE
intended	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
manner	CODE
instead	CODE
it	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
gateway	CODE
between	CODE
nativeunmanaged	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
net	CODE
it's	CODE
best	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
net	CODE
language	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
vbnet	CODE
or	CODE
c#	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
your	CODE
guis	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
net	CODE
you	CODE
currently	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
choice	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
winforms	CODE
library	CODE
or	CODE
wpf	CODE
i	CODE
personally	CODE
feel	CODE
that	CODE
you'd	CODE
be	CODE
wasting	CODE
time	CODE
learning	CODE
to	CODE
build	CODE
winforms	CODE
applications	CODE
given	CODE
that	CODE
wpf	CODE
is	CODE
designed	CODE
to	CODE
replace	CODE
it	CODE
over	CODE
time	CODE
wpf	CODE
will	CODE
become	CODE
more	CODE
prevelant	CODE
and	CODE
winforms	CODE
will	CODE
most	CODE
likely	CODE
die	CODE
off	CODE
wpf	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
much	CODE
richer	CODE
api	CODE
set	CODE
and	CODE
doesn't	CODE
suffer	CODE
from	CODE
many	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
limitations	CODE
that	CODE
winforms	CODE
does	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
choose	CODE
this	CODE
route	CODE
however	CODE
you'll	CODE
no	CODE
doubt	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
xaml	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
markup	CODE
language	CODE
that	CODE
drives	CODE
wpf	CODE
applications	CODE
this	CODE
technology	CODE
is	CODE
coming	CODE
of	CODE
age	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
many	CODE
great	CODE
places	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
about	CODE
it	CODE
first	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
sites	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
learnwpf	CODE
and	CODE
drwpf	CODE
which	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
really	CODE
great	CODE
articles	CODE
secondly	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
plenty	CODE
of	CODE
quality	CODE
books	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
topic	CODE
so	CODE
to	CODE
sum	CODE
up	CODE
once	CODE
you've	CODE
picked	CODE
your	CODE
language	CODE
and	CODE
tech	CODE
the	CODE
path	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
quite	CODE
easy	CODE
just	CODE
pick	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE
book	CODE
or	CODE
two	CODE
read	CODE
some	CODE
blogs	CODE
get	CODE
into	CODE
some	CODE
code	CODE
samples	CODE
and	CODE
most	CODE
importantly	CODE
write	CODE
code	CODE
keep	CODE
writing	CODE
keep	CODE
making	CODE
mistakes	CODE
and	CODE
keep	CODE
learning	CODE
from	CODE
them	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
final	CODE
note	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
words	CODE
silverlight	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
the	CODE
ms	CODE
route	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
give	CODE
adobe's	CODE
flashflex	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
see	CODE
both	CODE
silverlight	CODE
and	CODE
flashflex	CODE
build	CODE
ria's	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
is	CODE
where	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
headed	CODE
they	CODE
days	CODE
of	CODE
office	CODE
like	CODE
apps	CODE
are	CODE
numbered	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
agree	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
silverlight	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
as	CODE
wpf	CODE
silverlight	CODE
is	CODE
web-specific	CODE
and	CODE
only	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
subset	CODE
of	CODE
wpf's	CODE
features	CODE
given	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
asks	CODE
for	CODE
windows	CODE
gui	CODE
apps	CODE
flashflex	CODE
rich	CODE
internet	CODE
apps	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
a	CODE
fitting	CODE
suggestion	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
don't	CODE
agree	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
days	CODE
of	CODE
rich	CODE
client	CODE
applications	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
office	CODE
are	CODE
numbered	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
i	CODE
hope	CODE
that	CODE
helps	CODE
good	CODE
luck	CODE
i	CODE
won't	CODE
help	CODE
much	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
remember	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
wrap	CODE
matlab	CODE
simulation	CODE
into	CODE
dll	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
delphi	CODE
app	CODE
it	CODE
work	CODE
really	CODE
well	CODE
anyway	CODE
good	CODE
luck	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
itself	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
in	CODE
2003	CODE
version	CODE
references	CODE
the	CODE
ie	CODE
dll	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
render	CODE
the	CODE
design	CODE
view	CODE
it	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
worth	CODE
looking	CODE
into	CODE
that	CODE
otherwise	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
anything	CODE
beyond	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
browser	CODE
control	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
print	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
line	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
rundll32exe	CODE
%windir%\system32\mshtmldllprinthtml	CODE
%1	CODE
where	CODE
%1	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
path	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
html	CODE
file	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
printed	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
print	CODE
from	CODE
memory	CODE
or	CODE
can	CODE
afford	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
disk	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
temp	CODE
file	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
nb	CODE
this	CODE
only	CODE
works	CODE
on	CODE
windows	CODE
2000	CODE
and	CODE
above	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
scaling	CODE
the	CODE
relative	CODE
image	CODE
pixel	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
anywhere	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
pixels	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
is	CODE
scaled	CODE
down	CODE
significantly	CODE
pixel	CODE
2	CODE
10	CODE
could	CODE
represent	CODE
2	CODE
10	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
up	CODE
to	CODE
20	CODE
100	CODE
so	CODE
you'll	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
math	CODE
yourself	CODE
and	CODE
take	CODE
full	CODE
responsibility	CODE
for	CODE
any	CODE
inaccuracies	CODE
-	CODE
i	CODE
wound	CODE
up	CODE
just	CODE
implementing	CODE
the	CODE
translation	CODE
manually	CODE
the	CODE
code's	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
bad	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
did	CODE
leave	CODE
me	CODE
wishing	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
provided	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE
directly	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
see	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
being	CODE
useful	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
different	CODE
circumstances	CODE
i	CODE
guess	CODE
that's	CODE
why	CODE
they	CODE
added	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
in	CODE
pseudocode	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
pixel	CODE
position	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
image	CODE
you'd	CODE
just	CODE
multiply	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
image	CODE
pixel	CODE
dimensions	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
normalized	CODE
coordinates	CODE
allow	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
address	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
responder's	CODE
point	CODE
about	CODE
resolving	CODE
ambiguity	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
case-by-case	CODE
basis	CODE
scott	CODE

i	CODE
think	CODE
nunit	CODE
is	CODE
your	CODE
best	CODE
bet	CODE
with	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
great	CODE
integration	CODE
within	CODE
vsnet	CODE
resharper	CODE
also	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
unit	CODE
test	CODE
runner	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
nunit	CODE
it	CODE
simple	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
and	CODE
follows	CODE
an	CODE
established	CODE
paradigm	CODE
you'll	CODE
also	CODE
find	CODE
plenty	CODE
of	CODE
projectstutorialsguides	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
which	CODE
always	CODE
helps	CODE
your	CODE
other	CODE
main	CODE
choice	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
mbunit	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
and	CODE
more	CODE
position	CODE
itself	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
bdd	CODE
framework	CODE
of	CODE
choice	CODE
in	CODE
conjunction	CODE
with	CODE
gallio	CODE
httpwwwgallioorg	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2008	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
test	CODE
project	CODE
type	CODE
that	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
similar	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
nunit	CODE
but	CODE
obviously	CODE
has	CODE
much	CODE
tighter	CODE
integration	CODE
with	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
can	CODE
run	CODE
on	CODE
every	CODE
build	CODE
and	CODE
shows	CODE
the	CODE
results	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
similar	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
conversion	CODE
results	CODE
page	CODE
when	CODE
upgrading	CODE
solution	CODE
files	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
obviously	CODE
not	CODE
as	CODE
mature	CODE
as	CODE
nunit	CODE
as	CODE
it's	CODE
pretty	CODE
new	CODE
and	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
about	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
handles	CODE
mocking	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
worth	CODE
looking	CODE
into	CODE
when	CODE
your	CODE
team	CODE
moves	CODE
to	CODE
vs2008	CODE
mbunit	CODE
is	CODE
worth	CODE
alook	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
set	CODE
of	CODE
features	CODE
comparable	CODE
to	CODE
nunit	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
its	CODE
own	CODE
gui	CODE
or	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
integrated	CODE
into	CODE
vs	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
resharper	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
recommend	CODE
rhino	CODE
mocks	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
doing	CODE
any	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
tdd	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
say	CODE
mbunit	CODE
also	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
being	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
test	CODE
many	CODE
times	CODE
just	CODE
by	CODE
specifying	CODE
inputs	CODE
and	CODE
result	CODE
right	CODE
above	CODE
the	CODE
test	CODE
function	CODE
horrible	CODE
description	CODE
of	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
so	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
link	CODE
that	CODE
shows	CODE
you	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
mean	CODE
assuming	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
assemblies	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
compiler	CODE
you	CODE
in	CODE
theory	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
whatever	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
edit	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
just	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
by	CODE
hand	CODE
or	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
build	CODE
script	CODE
that	CODE
being	CODE
said	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
pain	CODE
doing	CODE
net	CODE
development	CODE
without	CODE
visual	CODE
studiosharpeditmonodevelop	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
opinion	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
nothing	CODE
vs	CODE
specific	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
mvc	CODE
framework	CODE
-	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
dlls	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE

in	CODE
vs	CODE
just	CODE
build	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
quick-start	CODE
framework	CODE
aspnet	CODE
mvc	CODE
is	CODE
bin-deployable	CODE
-	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
nothing	CODE
too	CODE
clever	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
up	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

either	CODE
-	CODE
just	CODE
point	CODE
the	CODE

i	CODE
can't	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE

shows	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE

which	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
language	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
for	CODE
work	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
python	CODE
syntax	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
ruby	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
rather	CODE
trivial	CODE
let's	CODE
say	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
array	CODE
that	CODE
prints	CODE
the	CODE
length	CODE
to	CODE
standard	CODE
out	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
modify	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE
class	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
instance	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
array	CODE
and	CODE
no	CODE
other	CODE
arrays	CODE
will	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
just	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
issues	CODE
involved	CODE
in	CODE
using	CODE
this	CODE
feature	CODE
jeff	CODE
atwood	CODE
actually	CODE
wrote	CODE
about	CODE
it	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
long	CODE
ago	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
functions	CODE
and	CODE
bound	CODE
methods	CODE
bound	CODE
methods	CODE
have	CODE
been	CODE
bound	CODE
how	CODE
descriptive	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
instance	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
instance	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
passed	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
argument	CODE
whenever	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
callables	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
attributes	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
as	CODE
opposed	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
instance	CODE
are	CODE
still	CODE
unbound	CODE
though	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
modify	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
definition	CODE
whenever	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
previously	CODE
defined	CODE
instances	CODE
are	CODE
updated	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
long	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
haven't	CODE
overridden	CODE
the	CODE
attribute	CODE
themselves	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
comes	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
attach	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
instance	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
automatically	CODE
bound	CODE
when	CODE
it's	CODE
attached	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
instance	CODE
to	CODE
bind	CODE
it	CODE

stick	CODE
with	CODE

it	CODE
has	CODE
more	CODE
support	CODE
understanding	CODE
and	CODE
general	CODE
acceptance	CODE
currently	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
internal	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
say	CODE
that	CODE
protocol	CODE
buffers	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
great	CODE
idea	CODE
maybe	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
years	CODE
as	CODE
more	CODE
tools	CODE
come	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
support	CODE
protocol	CODE
buffers	CODE
then	CODE
start	CODE
looking	CODE
towards	CODE
that	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
public	CODE
facing	CODE
api	CODE
until	CODE
then	CODE
json	CODE
protocol	CODE
buffers	CODE
are	CODE
intended	CODE
to	CODE
optimize	CODE
communications	CODE
between	CODE
machines	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
really	CODE
not	CODE
intended	CODE
for	CODE
human	CODE
interaction	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
format	CODE
is	CODE
binary	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
could	CODE
not	CODE
replace	CODE
xml	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
use	CODE
case	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
recommend	CODE
json	CODE
as	CODE
being	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
compact	CODE
text-based	CODE
format	CODE
the	CODE
previous	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
fine	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
guys	CODE
that's	CODE
firmly	CODE
against	CODE
mixing	CODE
behavior	CODE
with	CODE
presentation	CODE
putting	CODE
javascript	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
html	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
prefer	CODE
to	CODE
put	CODE
my	CODE
event	CODE
handling	CODE
logic	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
javascript	CODE
files	CODE
additionally	CODE
not	CODE
all	CODE
browsers	CODE
implement	CODE
event	CODE
or	CODE
e	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
check	CODE
prior	CODE
to	CODE
running	CODE
any	CODE
logic	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
advise	CODE
against	CODE
changing	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
behaviour	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
key	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
as	CODE
possible	CODE
without	CODE
touching	CODE
a	CODE
mouse	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
make	CODE
my	CODE
tab	CODE
key	CODE
not	CODE
move	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
field	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
very	CODE
aggravated	CODE
a	CODE
shortcut	CODE
key	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
useful	CODE
however	CODE
especially	CODE
with	CODE
large	CODE
code	CODE
blocks	CODE
and	CODE
nesting	CODE
shift-tab	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
bad	CODE
option	CODE
because	CODE
that	CODE
normally	CODE
takes	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
previous	CODE
field	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
form	CODE
maybe	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
button	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
wmd	CODE
editor	CODE
to	CODE
insert	CODE
a	CODE
code-tab	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
shortcut	CODE
key	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
possible	CODE
calling	CODE
processstart	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
mailto	CODE
protocol	CODE
as	CODE
shown	CODE
below	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
basic	CODE
functionality	CODE
but	CODE
not	CODE
attachments	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
approach	CODE
with	CODE
attachment	CODE
paths	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
option	CODE
only	CODE
works	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
old	CODE
version	CODE
of	CODE
outlook	CODE
such	CODE
as	CODE
98	CODE
i	CODE
assume	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
potential	CODE
securty	CODE
risk	CODE
if	CODE
anyone	CODE
does	CODE
use	CODE
outlookexe	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
security	CODE
warnings	CODE
under	CODE
outlook	CODE

2007	CODE
dependant	CODE
on	CODE

easy	CODE

here's	CODE
something	CODE
official	CODE

if	CODE
he's	CODE
interested	CODE
aren't	CODE
the	CODE
minor	CODE
details	CODE
the	CODE
good	CODE
parts	CODE
using	CODE
python	CODE
you've	CODE
already	CODE
cut	CODE
the	CODE
gui	CODE
off	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
confusion	CODE
is	CODE
gone	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
pick	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
a	CODE
game	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
and	CODE
implement	CODE
it	CODE
the	CODE
classic	CODE
hi-lo	CODE
number	CODE
guessing	CODE
game	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
simply	CODE
implemented	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
command	CODE
line	CODE
in	CODE
20-30	CODE
lines	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
language	CODE

and	CODE
gives	CODE
you	CODE
variables	CODE
conditions	CODE
loops	CODE
and	CODE
user	CODE
input	CODE
first	CODE
of	CODE
all	CODE
start	CODE
out	CODE
like	CODE
everyone	CODE
else	CODE
does	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
hello	CODE
world	CODE
program	CODE
it's	CODE
simple	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
gives	CODE
them	CODE
a	CODE
basic	CODE
feel	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
layout	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
program	CODE
try	CODE
and	CODE
remember	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
first	CODE
programming	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
difficult	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
were	CODE
-	CODE
start	CODE
simple	CODE
after	CODE
hello	CODE
world	CODE
move	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
creating	CODE
some	CODE
basic	CODE
variables	CODE
arithmetic	CODE
then	CODE
onto	CODE
boolean	CODE
logic	CODE
and	CODE
ifelse	CODE
statements	CODE
if	CODE
you've	CODE
got	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
old	CODE
programming	CODE
textbooks	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
early	CODE
examples	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
him	CODE
run	CODE
through	CODE
those	CODE
just	CODE
don't	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
introduce	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
all	CODE
at	CODE
once	CODE
or	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
overwhelming	CODE
and	CODE
confusing	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
actually	CODE
argue	CODE
to	CODE
pick	CODE
a	CODE
simpler	CODE
language	CODE
with	CODE
fewer	CODE
instructions	CODE
i	CODE
personally	CODE
learned	CODE
on	CODE
basic	CODE
at	CODE
home	CODE
as	CODE
did	CODE
jeff	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
delve	CODE
into	CODE
more	CODE
complicated	CODE
issues	CODE
like	CODE
object	CODE
oriented	CODE
programming	CODE
or	CODE
even	CODE
procedures	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
once	CODE
he	CODE
can	CODE
handle	CODE
simple	CODE
control	CODE
flow	CODE
then	CODE
move	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
more	CODE
complicated	CODE
but	CODE
only	CODE
simple	CODE
features	CODE
maybe	CODE
start	CODE
with	CODE
very	CODE
simple	CODE
programs	CODE
that	CODE
just	CODE
add	CODE
2	CODE
numbers	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
grow	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
might	CODE
require	CODE
a	CODE
branch	CODE
then	CODE
maybe	CODE
reading	CODE
input	CODE
and	CODE
responding	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
then	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
loop	CODE
and	CODE
start	CODE
combining	CODE
them	CODE
all	CODE
together	CODE
just	CODE
start	CODE
little	CODE
and	CODE
work	CODE
your	CODE
way	CODE
up	CODE
don't	CODE
do	CODE
any	CODE
big	CODE
projects	CODE
until	CODE
he	CODE
can	CODE
grasp	CODE
the	CODE
fundamentals	CODE
otherwise	CODE
it	CODE
may	CODE
very	CODE
well	CODE
be	CODE
too	CODE
daunting	CODE
and	CODE
he	CODE
could	CODE
give	CODE
up	CODE
midway	CODE
once	CODE
he's	CODE
mastered	CODE
basic	CODE
or	CODE
whatever	CODE
you	CODE
choose	CODE
move	CODE
on	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
more	CODE
complicated	CODE
just	CODE
my	CODE
$002	CODE
something	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
very	CODE
mindful	CODE
of	CODE
while	CODE
teaching	CODE
your	CODE
brother	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
him	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
rely	CODE
too	CODE
heavily	CODE
on	CODE
you	CODE
often	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
find	CODE
myself	CODE
helping	CODE
others	CODE
they	CODE
will	CODE
begin	CODE
to	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
me	CODE
as	CODE
answer	CODE
book	CODE
to	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
their	CODE
questions	CODE
and	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
experimenting	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
an	CODE
answer	CODE
they	CODE
simply	CODE
ask	CODE
me	CODE
often	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
teacher	CODE
is	CODE
experimentation	CODE
and	CODE
every	CODE
time	CODE
your	CODE
brother	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
question	CODE
like	CODE
what	CODE
will	CODE
happen	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
add	CODE
2	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
tell	CODE
him	CODE
to	CODE
try	CODE
it	CODE
out	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
for	CODE
himself	CODE
also	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
noticed	CODE
that	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
cannot	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
concept	CODE
through	CODE
to	CODE
someone	CODE
it	CODE
helps	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
some	CODE
sample	CODE
code	CODE
where	CODE
we	CODE
can	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
each	CODE
segment	CODE
individually	CODE
and	CODE
explain	CODE
it	CODE
piece	CODE
by	CODE
piece	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
side	CODE
note	CODE
people	CODE
new	CODE
to	CODE
programming	CODE
often	CODE
have	CODE
trouble	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
object	CODE
oriented	CODE
programming	CODE
they	CODE
will	CODE
say	CODE
they	CODE
understand	CODE
it	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
teach	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
them	CODE
but	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
clear	CODE
concept	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
until	CODE
actually	CODE
implementing	CODE
it	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
try	CODE

are	CODE
often	CODE
syntax	CODE
errors	CODE

writing	CODE

pick	CODE

where	CODE
you	CODE
start	CODE
introducing	CODE
the	CODE

even	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE

by	CODE
reading	CODE
the	CODE

you	CODE
should	CODE
teach	CODE

how	CODE

use	CODE
the	CODE

then	CODE
show	CODE
them	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE

see	CODE
it	CODE
that	CODE
serves	CODE
the	CODE
dual	CODE
purpose	CODE
of	CODE

teaching	CODE

the	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE

its	CODE
good	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
then	CODE
expand	CODE
the	CODE

with	CODE
some	CODE

which	CODE
you	CODE
never	CODE
planned	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
usually	CODE
means	CODE
refactoring	CODE
and	CODE
significant	CODE

since	CODE
very	CODE

its	CODE

experience	CODE
having	CODE

obviously	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
adjust	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
person	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
important	CODE
thing	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
even	CODE
the	CODE

apply	CODE

i	CODE
used	CODE

your	CODE
brother	CODE
has	CODE
one	CODE
main	CODE
advantage	CODE
over	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
students	CODE
he	CODE
wants	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
decide	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
c	CODE
a	CODE
friend	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
site	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
programs	CODE
those	CODE
of	CODE
use	CODE
from	CODE
older	CODE
generations	CODE
remember	CODE
as	CODE
basic	CODE
type-ins	CODE
the	CODE
more	CODE
complex	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
use	CODE
ncurses	CODE
which	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
negates	CODE
their	CODE
use	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
teaching	CODE
aid	CODE
somewhat	CODE
but	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
are	CODE
tiny	CODE
little	CODE
things	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
learn	CODE
loads	CODE
without	CODE
being	CODE
taught	CODE
to	CODE
personally	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
python	CODE
and	CODE
ruby	CODE
would	CODE
make	CODE
great	CODE
first	CODE
languages	CODE
edit	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
beginner	CODE
programming	CODE
assignments	CODE
appeared	CODE
overnight	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
just	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
wisdom	CODE
of	CODE
crowds	CODE
work	CODE
here	CODE
how	CODE
did	CODE
most	CODE
people	CODE
learn	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
many	CODE
claim	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
did	CODE
so	CODE
by	CODE
copying	CODE
programs	CODE
of	CODE
others	CODE
usually	CODE
games	CODE
they	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
play	CODE
in	CODE
basic	CODE
maybe	CODE
that	CODE
route	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
him	CODE
too	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
teach	CODE
the	CODE
basics	CODE
of	CODE
programming	CODE
without	CODE
being	CODE
language	CODE
specific	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
called	CODE
scratch	CODE
that	CODE
was	CODE
created	CODE
in	CODE
mit	CODE
it's	CODE
designed	CODE
to	CODE
help	CODE
people	CODE
develop	CODE
programming	CODE
skills	CODE
as	CODE
users	CODE
create	CODE
scratch	CODE
projects	CODE
they	CODE
learn	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
conditions	CODE
loops	CODE
etc	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
also	CODE
a	CODE
community	CODE
of	CODE
scratch	CODE
projects	CODE
form	CODE
which	CODE
projects	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
downloaded	CODE
-	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
explore	CODE
other	CODE
people's	CODE
programs	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
how	CODE
they	CODE
were	CODE
built	CODE
i	CODE
recently	CODE
wrote	CODE
an	CODE
article	CODE
titled	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
teach	CODE
your	CODE
girlfriend	CODE
programming	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
little	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
with	CODE
girlfriends	CODE
and	CODE
everything	CODE
about	CODE
teaching	CODE
something	CODE
technical	CODE
to	CODE
someone	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
understand	CODE
it	CODE
i'm	CODE
told	CODE
it's	CODE
also	CODE
funny	CODE
it	CODE
really	CODE
depends	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
brother's	CODE
learning	CODE
style	CODE
many	CODE
people	CODE
learn	CODE
faster	CODE
by	CODE
getting	CODE
their	CODE
hands	CODE
dirty	CODE
just	CODE
getting	CODE
into	CODE
it	CODE
crystallising	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
big	CODE
picture	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
progress	CODE
and	CODE
build	CODE
their	CODE
knowledge	CODE
me	CODE
i	CODE
prefer	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
big	CODE
picture	CODE
and	CODE
drill	CODE
down	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
nitty-gritty	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
thing	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
was	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
all	CODE
fits	CODE
together	CODE
then	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
object-oriented	CODE
gobbledygook	CODE
then	CODE
about	CODE
classes	CODE
instances	CODE
and	CODE
so-on	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
the	CODE
underlying	CODE
concepts	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
theory	CODE
before	CODE
i	CODE
learn	CODE
the	CODE
syntax	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
advantage	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
wrote	CODE
some	CODE
games	CODE
in	CODE
basic	CODE
20	CODE
years	CODE
ago	CODE
but	CODE
nothing	CODE
much	CODE
since	CODE
perhaps	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
useful	CODE
to	CODE
shadow	CODE
a	CODE
production	CODE
process	CODE
by	CODE
starting	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
overall	CODE
mission	CODE
statement	CODE
then	CODE
a	CODE
plan	CODE
andor	CODE
flowchart	CODE
then	CODE
elaborate	CODE
into	CODE
some	CODE
pseudo	CODE
code	CODE
leaning	CODE
towards	CODE
the	CODE
syntax	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
ultimately	CODE
use	CODE
before	CODE
actually	CODE
writing	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
golden	CODE
rule	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
suss	CODE
out	CODE
your	CODE
student's	CODE
leaning	CODE
style	CODE
try	CODE
ruby	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
browser	CODE
i	CODE
agree	CODE
with	CODE
leac	CODE
i	CODE
actually	CODE
play	CODE
with	CODE
scratch	CODE
sometimes	CODE
if	CODE
i'm	CODE
bored	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
fun	CODE
visual	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
code	CODE
how	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
is	CODE
they	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
blocks	CODE
these	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
legos	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
stack	CODE
and	CODE
by	CODE
stacking	CODE
these	CODE
blocks	CODE
and	CODE
interacting	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
canvas	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
put	CODE
your	CODE
sprites	CODE
graphics	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
create	CODE
games	CODE
movies	CODE
slideshows	CODE
it's	CODE
really	CODE
interesting	CODE
when	CODE
it's	CODE
complete	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
upload	CODE
it	CODE
right	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
scratch	CODE
websites	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
youtube-ish	CODE
portal	CODE
for	CODE
scratch	CODE
applications	CODE
not	CODE
only	CODE
that	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
download	CODE
any	CODE
submission	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
website	CODE
and	CODE
learn	CODE
from	CODE
or	CODE
extend	CODE
other	CODE
scratch	CODE
applications	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
fantastic	CODE
book	CODE
which	CODE
my	CODE
little	CODE
brothers	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
the	CODE
most	CODE
important	CODE
thing	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
useful	CODE
program	CODE
of	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
immediately	CODE
after	CODE
finishing	CODE
the	CODE
book	CODE
i	CODE
recommend	CODE
starting	CODE
them	CODE
off	CODE
with	CODE
cc++	CODE
i	CODE
find	CODE
that	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
foundation	CODE
for	CODE
just	CODE
about	CODE
every	CODE
other	CODE
language	CODE
also	CODE
the	CODE
different	CODE
versions	CODE
of	CODE
basic	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
pretty	CODE
dodgy	CODE
at	CODE
best	CODE
and	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
real	CODE
correlation	CODE
to	CODE
actual	CODE
programming	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
learning	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
will	CODE
never	CODE
be	CODE
as	CODE
good	CODE
as	CODE
learning	CODE
to	CODE
program	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
your	CODE
brother	CODE
is	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
making	CODE
work	CODE
because	CODE
he	CODE
wants	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
work	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
leave	CODE
him	CODE
with	CODE
google	CODE
and	CODE
he'll	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
he'll	CODE
have	CODE
you	CODE
around	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
he's	CODE
going	CODE
along	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
path	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
biggest	CODE
problems	CODE
with	CODE
teaching	CODE
programming	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
abstract	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
got	CODE
a	CODE
real-world	CODE
context	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
learner	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
emotionally	CODE
invested	CODE
in	CODE
programming	CODE
is	CODE
hard	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
some	CODE
real	CODE
payoff	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
worth	CODE
the	CODE
effort	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
case	CODE
i'd	CODE
done	CODE
computer	CODE
science	CODE
at	CODE
uni	CODE
learned	CODE
pascal	CODE
and	CODE
cobol	CODE
there	CODE
and	CODE
learned	CODE
basic	CODE
at	CODE
home	CODE
before	CODE
that	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
never	CODE
really	CODE
got	CODE
anywhere	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
until	CODE
i	CODE
became	CODE
a	CODE
self-employed	CODE
web	CODE
designer	CODE
back	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
90s	CODE
and	CODE
my	CODE
clients	CODE
needed	CODE
functionality	CODE
on	CODE
their	CODE
web	CODE
sites	CODE
and	CODE
were	CODE
willing	CODE
to	CODE
pay	CODE
about	CODE
10x	CODE
more	CODE
for	CODE
functionality	CODE
than	CODE
for	CODE
design	CODE
putting	CODE
food	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
table	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
hell	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
motivator	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
perl	CODE
then	CODE
aspvbscript	CODE
then	CODE
javascript	CODE
then	CODE
flashactionscript	CODE
then	CODE
php	CODE
-	CODE
all	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
stuff	CODE
i	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
happen	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
design	CODE
programs	CODE
structure	CODE
and	CODE
interpretation	CODE
of	CODE
computer	CODE
programs	CODE
videos	CODE
lectures	CODE
at	CODE
httpwwwswissaimiteduclasses6001abelson-sussman-lectures	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
once	CODE
he	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
basics	CODE
variables	CODE
loops	CODE
etc	CODE
down	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
help	CODE
him	CODE
find	CODE
something	CODE
specific	CODE
that	CODE
he	CODE
is	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
and	CODE
help	CODE
him	CODE
learn	CODE
the	CODE
necessities	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
happen	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
much	CODE
more	CODE
inclined	CODE
and	CODE
motivated	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
of	CODE
interest	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
also	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
to	CODE
let	CODE
him	CODE
struggle	CODE
though	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
tougher	CODE
problems	CODE
nothing	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
satisfying	CODE
than	CODE
the	CODE
moment	CODE
you	CODE
figure	CODE
it	CODE
out	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
i'd	CODE
just	CODE
let	CODE
him	CODE
write	CODE
tons	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
let	CODE
him	CODE
drive	CODE
in	CODE
everything	CODE
you	CODE
guys	CODE
do	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
be	CODE
available	CODE
to	CODE
answer	CODE
questions	CODE
believe	CODE
it	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
months	CODE
of	CODE
writings	CODE
tons	CODE
of	CODE
crappy	CODE
code	CODE
he'll	CODE
start	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
idea	CODE
and	CODE
start	CODE
writing	CODE
better	CODE
programs	CODE
at	CODE
that	CODE
point	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
bogged	CODE
down	CODE
in	CODE
details	CODE
memory	CODE
etc	CODE
and	CODE
also	CODE
talk	CODE
about	CODE
general	CODE
design	CODE
principles	CODE
i've	CODE
heard	CODE
that	CODE
what	CODE
separates	CODE
the	CODE
great	CODE
artists	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
mediocre	CODE
ones	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
every	CODE
time	CODE
they	CODE
practice	CODE
they	CODE
improve	CODE
on	CODE
something	CODE
no	CODE
matter	CODE
how	CODE
small	CODE
let	CODE
your	CODE
brother	CODE
practice	CODE

he'll	CODE
improve	CODE
every	CODE

he	CODE

this	CODE
reminds	CODE
me	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
recent	CODE
coding	CODE
horror	CODE
post	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
right	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
its	CODE
still	CODE
worthwhile	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
methods	CODE
to	CODE
guide	CODE
his	CODE
practice	CODE
no	CODE
question	CODE
i	CODE
want	CODE
him	CODE
writing	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
code	CODE
as	CODE
he	CODE
knows	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
thats	CODE
one	CODE
reason	CODE
i'm	CODE
asking	CODE
for	CODE
sample	CODE
projects	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
taught	CODE
by	CODE
learning	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
problems	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
agnostic	CODE
way	CODE
using	CODE
flowcharts	CODE
and	CODE
pdl	CODE
program	CODE
design	CODE
language	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
weeks	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
the	CODE
pdl	CODE
i	CODE
had	CODE
written	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
glad	CODE
i	CODE
learned	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
spent	CODE
the	CODE
majority	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
years	CODE
programming	CODE
solving	CODE
problems	CODE
without	CODE
being	CODE
tied	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
what	CODE
language	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
has	CODE
always	CODE
been	CODE
an	CODE
implementation	CODE
detail	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
design	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
by	CODE
breaking	CODE
it	CODE
down	CODE
into	CODE
it's	CODE
basic	CODE
steps	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
key	CODE
skill	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
things	CODE
that	CODE
separates	CODE
those	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
program	CODE
from	CODE
those	CODE
that	CODE
can't	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE
tackle	CODE
the	CODE
order	CODE
of	CODE
concepts	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
the	CODE
easiest	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
decide	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
in	CODE
mind	CODE
and	CODE
tackle	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
needed	CODE
this	CODE
lets	CODE
you	CODE
apply	CODE
them	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
needed	CODE
on	CODE
something	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
interested	CODE
in	CODE
doing	CODE
when	CODE
learning	CODE
a	CODE
language	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
several	CODE
simple	CODE
projects	CODE
in	CODE
mind	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
with	CODE
progressive	CODE
complexity	CODE
deciding	CODE
on	CODE
those	CODE
will	CODE
help	CODE
you	CODE
map	CODE
out	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
needed	CODE
and	CODE
their	CODE
order	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
stuff	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
as	CODE
using	CODE
10*	CODE
or	CODE
100*	CODE
will	CODE
replace	CODE
the	CODE
revision	CODE
and	CODE
build	CODE
numbers	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
coded	CODE
datetimestamp	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
usually	CODE
also	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
way	CODE
for	CODE
more	CODE

this	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
configured	CODE

there	CODE
are	CODE
2	CODE
gotchas	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
4	CODE
numbers	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
version	CODE
string	CODE
is	CODE
limited	CODE
to	CODE
65535	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
limitation	CODE
and	CODE
unlikely	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
fixed	CODE
why	CODE
are	CODE
build	CODE
numbers	CODE
limited	CODE
to	CODE
65535	CODE
using	CODE
with	CODE
with	CODE
subversion	CODE
requires	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
change	CODE
using	CODE

to	CODE
generate	CODE

info	CODE
at	CODE
build	CODE
time	CODE
including	CODE

fix	CODE
retrieving	CODE
the	CODE
version	CODE

is	CODE
then	CODE
quite	CODE
easy	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
clarify	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
the	CODE
build	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
the	CODE
third	CODE

not	CODE
the	CODE
fourth	CODE
one	CODE

some	CODE
people	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
delphi	CODE

are	CODE
used	CODE

it's	CODE
majorminorbuildrevision	CODE
what	CODE

are	CODE
you	CODE
using	CODE
almost	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE

tag	CODE
that	CODE
gets	CODE
expanded	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE

checked	CODE
in	CODE
i	CODE
usually	CODE
use	CODE
some	CODE
form	CODE

hackery	CODE
to	CODE
display	CODE
this	CODE

the	CODE

i	CODE
use	CODE

i	CODE
found	CODE
it	CODE
helpful	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
build	CODE
number	CODE
to	CODE
subversion	CODE
revision	CODE

thereby	CODE
making	CODE
it	CODE
really	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
always	CODE
get	CODE

that	CODE

i	CODE
can	CODE
also	CODE
convert	CODE
these	CODE
jpegs	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE

i	CODE
can	CODE
even	CODE
convert	CODE
the	CODE
pdf	CODE
directly	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
jpeg	CODE
thumbnail	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
result	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
thumbnailjpg0	CODE
and	CODE
thumbnailjpg1	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
two	CODE
pages	CODE
while	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
used	CODE
a	CODE
flash	CODE
object	CODE
inside	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
form	CODE
application	CODE
myself	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
it's	CODE
possible	CODE
in	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
toolbox	CODE
choose	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE

then	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
window	CODE
that	CODE
appears	CODE
choose	CODE
the	CODE
com	CODE
components	CODE
tab	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
in	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
shockwave	CODE
flash	CODE
object	CODE
once	CODE
added	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
toolbox	CODE
simply	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
use	CODE
any	CODE
other	CODE
standard	CODE
control	CODE
from	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
three	CODE
simple	CODE
commands	CODE
are	CODE
available	CODE

interact	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
axshockwaveflash1stop	CODE
axshockwaveflash1movie	CODE

filepath	CODE
\filenameswf	CODE
axshockwaveflash1play	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
are	CODE
all	CODE
self	CODE
explanatory	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
great	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
flash	CODE
content	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
stream	CODE
of	CODE
sorts	CODE
rather	CODE
than	CODE
a	CODE
file	CODE
on	CODE
disk	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
saw	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
also	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
means	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
content	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
stream	CODE
and	CODE
because	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
shockwave	CODE
flash	CODE
object	CODE
i	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
another	CODE
option	CODE
two	CODE
actually	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
one	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
advise	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
only	CODE
when	CODE
necessary	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
uses	CODE
the	CODE
full	CODE
blown	CODE
webbrowser	CODE
component	CODE
also	CODE
available	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
extra	CODE
toolbox	CODE
item	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
like	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
shoot	CODE
a	CODE
fly	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
bazooka	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
work	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
will	CODE
act	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
real	CODE
browser	CODE
window	CODE
actually	CODE
the	CODE
internet	CODE
explorer	CODE
browser	CODE
but	CODE
its	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
meant	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
it	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
option	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
something	CODE
i	CODE
just	CODE
discovered	CODE
while	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
more	CODE
information	CODE
about	CODE
playing	CODE
flash	CODE
content	CODE
inside	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
form	CODE
f-in-box	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
commercial	CODE
solution	CODE
that	CODE
will	CODE
also	CODE
play	CODE
content	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
given	CODE
website	CODE
url	CODE
the	CODE
link	CODE
provided	CODE
will	CODE
direct	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
code	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
sven	CODE
you	CODE
reached	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
conclusion	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
did	CODE
i	CODE
found	CODE
the	CODE
shockwave	CODE
flash	CODE
object	CODE
all	CODE
be	CODE
it	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
slightly	CODE
different	CODE
route	CODE
but	CODE
was	CODE
stumped	CODE
on	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
files	CODE
from	CODE
somewhere	CODE
other	CODE
than	CODE
file	CODE
on	CODE
diskurl	CODE
the	CODE
f-in-box	CODE
although	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
wrapper	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
shockwave	CODE
flash	CODE
object	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
provide	CODE
much	CODE
more	CODE
functionality	CODE
which	CODE
may	CODE
just	CODE
help	CODE
me	CODE
shooting	CODE
flys	CODE
with	CODE
bazookas	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
fun	CODE
but	CODE
an	CODE
embeded	CODE
web	CODE
brower	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
path	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
a	CODE
link	CODE
on	CODE
adobe's	CODE
site	CODE
that	CODE
talked	CODE
about	CODE
embedding	CODE
and	CODE
communicating	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
macromedia	CODE
flash	CODE
player	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
windows	CODE
applications	CODE
but	CODE
they	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
removed	CODE
it	CODE
one	CODE
implementation	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
attempt	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
parameter-less	CODE
constructor	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
approach	CODE
contained	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
generic	CODE
method	CODE
the	CODE
activator	CODE
class	CODE
within	CODE
the	CODE
root	CODE
system	CODE
namespace	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
powerful	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
overloads	CODE
for	CODE
passing	CODE
parameters	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
and	CODE
such	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
the	CODE
documentation	CODE
at	CODE
httpmsdnmicrosoftcomen-uslibrarysystemactivatorcreateinstanceaspx	CODE
here	CODE
are	CODE
some	CODE
simple	CODE
examples	CODE
open	CODE
up	CODE
a	CODE
terminal	CODE
applications-utilities-terminal	CODE
and	CODE
type	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
spit	CODE
out	CODE
every	CODE
file	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
warning	CODE
there	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
alot	CODE
to	CODE
wade	CODE
through	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
anything	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
directly	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you'll	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
iterate	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
various	CODE
font	CODE
folders	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
system	CODE
systemlibraryfonts	CODE
libraryfonts	CODE
and	CODE
there	CODE
can	CODE
probably	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
user-level	CODE
directory	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
~libraryfonts	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
api	CODE
that	CODE
isn't	CODE
deprecated	CODE
is	CODE
located	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
applicationservices	CODE
framework	CODE
which	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
bridge	CODE
support	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
isn't	CODE
available	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
bridge	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
wanting	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
ctypes	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
atsfontgetfilereference	CODE
after	CODE
looking	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
atsfontref	CODE
cocoa	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
any	CODE
native	CODE
support	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
as	CODE
of	CODE
105	CODE
for	CODE
getting	CODE
the	CODE
location	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
font	CODE
java	CODE
autoboxingunboxing	CODE
doesn't	CODE
go	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
extent	CODE
to	CODE
allow	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
dereference	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
so	CODE
your	CODE
compiler	CODE
prevents	CODE
it	CODE
your	CODE
compiler	CODE
still	CODE
knows	CODE
myint	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
there's	CODE
a	CODE
paper	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
issue	CODE
at	CODE
jcporg	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
is	CODE
mainly	CODE
useful	CODE
during	CODE
assignment	CODE
or	CODE
parameter	CODE
passing	CODE
--	CODE
allowing	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
pass	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
or	CODE
vice	CODE
versa	CODE
or	CODE
assign	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
or	CODE
vice	CODE
versa	CODE
so	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
kudos	CODE
patrick	CODE
i	CODE
switched	CODE
to	CODE
your	CODE
way	CODE
ditto	CODE
on	CODE
what	CODE
justin	CODE
said	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
instead	CODE
it	CODE
saves	CODE
an	CODE
allocation	CODE
or	CODE
two	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
readable	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
shortcoming	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
specification	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
shortcomings	CODE
and	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
subtle	CODE
topic	CODE
check	CODE
this	CODE
out	CODE
here	CODE
long	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
printed	CODE
haven't	CODE
checked	CODE
it	CODE
myself	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
choses	CODE
widening	CODE
over	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
be	CODE
careful	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
autoboxing	CODE
or	CODE
don't	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
at	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
actually	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE

the	CODE

the	CODE

type	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE

in	CODE

the	CODE

type	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE

as	CODE

and	CODE
is	CODE

ie	CODE
more	CODE

the	CODE

an	CODE

any	CODE
other	CODE

can	CODE
be	CODE
boxed	CODE
wrapped	CODE
into	CODE

the	CODE
differences	CODE
between	CODE
objects	CODE
and	CODE
primitives	CODE
are	CODE
somewhat	CODE
beyond	CODE
the	CODE
scope	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
question	CODE
but	CODE
to	CODE
summarize	CODE
objects	CODE
provide	CODE
facilities	CODE
for	CODE
polymorphism	CODE
are	CODE
passed	CODE
by	CODE
reference	CODE
or	CODE
more	CODE
accurately	CODE
have	CODE
references	CODE
passed	CODE
by	CODE
value	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
allocated	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
heap	CODE
conversely	CODE
primitives	CODE
are	CODE
immutable	CODE
types	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
passed	CODE
by	CODE
value	CODE
and	CODE
are	CODE
often	CODE
allocated	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
stack	CODE
well	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
while	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
meaning	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
made	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
integer	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
call	CODE
some	CODE
method	CODE
on	CODE
i	CODE
whereas	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
you	CODE
cannot	CODE
call	CODE
any	CODE
methods	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
simply	CODE
a	CODE
primitive	CODE
so	CODE
would	CODE
produce	CODE
an	CODE
error	CODE
because	CODE
int	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
int	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
few	CODE
primitives	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
along	CODE
with	CODE
char	CODE
and	CODE
some	CODE
others	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
100%	CODE
sure	CODE
but	CODE
i'm	CODE
thinking	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
integer	CODE
object	CODE
more	CODE
or	CODE
less	CODE
just	CODE
has	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
property	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
methods	CODE
to	CODE
interact	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
property	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
tostring	CODE
method	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
so	CODE
integer	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
fancy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
just	CODE
as	CODE
perhaps	CODE
string	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
fancy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
group	CODE
of	CODE
chars	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
that	CODE
java	CODE
isn't	CODE
c	CODE
but	CODE
since	CODE
i've	CODE
never	CODE
programmed	CODE
in	CODE
c	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
closest	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
come	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE

this	CODE
helps	CODE

because	CODE
they	CODE

i	CODE
know	CODE
i'll	CODE
add	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
excellent	CODE
answers	CODE
given	CODE
above	CODE
and	CODE
talk	CODE
about	CODE
boxing	CODE
and	CODE
unboxing	CODE
and	CODE
how	CODE
this	CODE
applies	CODE
to	CODE
java	CODE
although	CODE
c#	CODE
has	CODE
it	CODE
too	CODE
i'll	CODE
use	CODE
just	CODE
java	CODE
terminology	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
more	CODE
au	CODE
fait	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
answers	CODE
mentioned	CODE
int	CODE
is	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
number	CODE
called	CODE
the	CODE
unboxed	CODE
type	CODE
whereas	CODE
integer	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
which	CODE
contains	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
hence	CODE
a	CODE
boxed	CODE
type	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
terms	CODE
that	CODE
means	CODE
apart	CODE
from	CODE
not	CODE
being	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
methods	CODE
on	CODE
int	CODE
you	CODE
cannot	CODE
store	CODE
int	CODE
or	CODE
other	CODE
non-object	CODE
types	CODE
in	CODE
collections	CODE
list	CODE
map	CODE
etc	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
them	CODE
you	CODE
must	CODE
first	CODE
box	CODE
them	CODE
up	CODE
in	CODE
its	CODE
corresponding	CODE
boxed	CODE
type	CODE
java	CODE
5	CODE
onwards	CODE
have	CODE
something	CODE
called	CODE
auto-boxing	CODE
and	CODE
auto-unboxing	CODE
which	CODE
allow	CODE
the	CODE
boxingunboxing	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
behind	CODE
the	CODE
scenes	CODE
compare	CODE
and	CODE
contrast	CODE
java	CODE
5	CODE
version	CODE
java	CODE
14	CODE
or	CODE
earlier	CODE
no	CODE
generics	CODE
either	CODE
it	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
noted	CODE
that	CODE
despite	CODE
the	CODE
brevity	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
java	CODE
5	CODE
version	CODE
both	CODE
versions	CODE
generate	CODE
identical	CODE
bytecode	CODE
thus	CODE
although	CODE
auto-boxing	CODE
and	CODE
auto-unboxing	CODE
is	CODE
very	CODE
convenient	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
write	CODE
less	CODE
code	CODE
these	CODE
operations	CODE
do	CODE
happen	CODE
behind	CODE
the	CODE
scenes	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
runtime	CODE
costs	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
still	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
of	CODE
their	CODE
existence	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE

you	CODE

also	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE

you	CODE
with	CODE

tho	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
thought	CODE
too	CODE
hard	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
reckon	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
custom	CODE
treeview	CODE
in	CODE
wpf	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
reading	CODE
an	CODE
article	CODE
on	CODE
code	CODE
project	CODE
a	CODE
while	CODE
back	CODE
that	CODE
implemented	CODE
an	CODE
org	CODE
chart	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
i'm	CODE
all	CODE
for	CODE
writing	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
software	CODE
when	CODE
something	CODE
doesn't	CODE
suit	CODE
your	CODE
needs	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
frequent	CODE
re-inventer	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
wheel	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
honestly	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
things	CODE
were	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
is	CODE
readily	CODE
available	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
of	CODE
family	CODE
tree	CODE
maker	CODE
and	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
mere	CODE
$40	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
venture	CODE
to	CODE
guess	CODE
that	CODE
you'd	CODE
come	CODE
out	CODE
ahead	CODE
compared	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
hours	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
spend	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
program	CODE
doing	CODE
exactly	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
i	CODE
currently	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
software	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
great	CODE
now	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
interest	CODE
in	CODE
writing	CODE
it	CODE
partly	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
purpose	CODE
of	CODE
just	CODE
doing	CODE
it	CODE
because	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
somethingthen	CODE
by	CODE
all	CODE
means	CODE
i	CODE
salute	CODE
your	CODE

to	CODE
learn	CODE
and	CODE
hope	CODE
you	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
geni	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
what	CODE
your	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
really	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
application	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
modify	CODE
try	CODE
out	CODE
familyshow	CODE
on	CODE
codeplex	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
creating	CODE

using	CODE

monikers	CODE
about	CODE
asynchronous	CODE
pluggable	CODE
protocols	CODE

registering	CODE
an	CODE

a	CODE

protocol	CODE
from	CODE
msdn	CODE
here's	CODE
some	CODE
old	CODE
delphi	CODE
code	CODE
we	CODE
used	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
shortcuts	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
program	CODE
locally	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
a	CODE
tidier	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
separate	CODE
forms	CODE
for	CODE
each	CODE
'pane'	CODE
and	CODE
in	CODE
each	CODE
form	CODE
constructor	CODE
set	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
these	CODE
forms	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
laid	CODE
out	CODE
in	CODE
its	CODE
own	CODE
designer	CODE
instantiated	CODE
one	CODE
or	CODE
more	CODE
times	CODE
at	CODE
runtime	CODE
and	CODE
added	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
empty	CODE
area	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
normal	CODE
control	CODE
perhaps	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
form	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
splitcontainer	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
static	CODE
treeview	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
panel	CODE
and	CODE
space	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
these	CODE
forms	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
once	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
added	CODE
they	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
flipped	CODE
through	CODE
using	CODE
hideshow	CODE
or	CODE
bringtofrontsendtoback	CODE
methods	CODE
greg	CODE
hurlman	CODE
wrote	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
showhide	CODE
the	CODE
proper	CODE
container	CODE
when	CODE
a	CODE
node	CODE
is	CODE
selected	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
grid	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
containers	CODE
all	CODE
sized	CODE
appropriately	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
spot	CODE
and	CODE
hide	CODE
all	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
which	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
preselected	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
grid	CODE
on	CODE
load	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
that's	CODE
what	CODE
i'm	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
avoid	CODE
i'm	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
easy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE
interface	CODE
during	CODE
design	CODE
time	CODE
with	CODE
minimal	CODE
reformatting	CODE
code	CODE
needed	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
working	CODE
during	CODE
run	CODE
time	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
duncan's	CODE
answer	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
means	CODE
the	CODE
design	CODE
of	CODE
each	CODE
node's	CODE
interface	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
kept	CODE
completely	CODE
separate	CODE
this	CODE
means	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
get	CODE
overlap	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
snapping	CODE
guidelines	CODE
and	CODE
other	CODE
design	CODE
time	CODE
advantages	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
cannot	CODE
be	CODE
inherited	CODE
or	CODE
overridden	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
why	CODE
they	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
abstract	CODE
since	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
are	CODE
defined	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
instance	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
they	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
called	CODE
explicitly	CODE
on	CODE
that	CODE
type	CODE
so	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
a	CODE
method	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
child	CODE
class	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
its	CODE
name	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
makes	CODE
inheritance	CODE
irrelevant	CODE
assume	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
moment	CODE
inherit	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
imagine	CODE
this	CODE
scenario	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
call	CODE
basegetnumber	CODE
which	CODE
method	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
called	CODE
which	CODE
value	CODE
returned	CODE
its	CODE
pretty	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
that	CODE
without	CODE
creating	CODE
instances	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
inheritance	CODE
is	CODE
rather	CODE
hard	CODE
abstract	CODE
methods	CODE
without	CODE
inheritance	CODE
are	CODE
just	CODE
methods	CODE
that	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
body	CODE
so	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
called	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
previous	CODE
explanations	CODE
static	CODE
method	CODE
calls	CODE
are	CODE
bound	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
specific	CODE
method	CODE
at	CODE
compile-time	CODE
which	CODE
rather	CODE
rules	CODE
out	CODE
polymorphic	CODE
behavior	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
instantiated	CODE
as	CODE
such	CODE
they're	CODE
just	CODE
available	CODE
without	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
reference	CODE
a	CODE
call	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
static	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
done	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
name	CODE
not	CODE
through	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
reference	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
il	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
abstract	CODE
method	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
that	CODE
defined	CODE
it	CODE
not	CODE
necessarily	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
you	CODE
used	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
show	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
code	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
call	CODE
btest	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
code	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
call	CODE
is	CODE
made	CODE
to	CODE
atest	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
the	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
that	CODE
defined	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
btest	CODE
even	CODE
though	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
way	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
had	CODE
class	CODE
types	CODE
like	CODE
in	CODE
delphi	CODE
where	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
referring	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
type	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
more	CODE
use	CODE
for	CODE
virtual	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
abstract	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
and	CODE
also	CODE
constructors	CODE
but	CODE
they	CODE
aren't	CODE
available	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
static	CODE
calls	CODE
are	CODE
non-virtual	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
i	CODE
realize	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
il	CODE
designers	CODE
could	CODE
allow	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
compiled	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
btest	CODE
and	CODE
resolve	CODE
the	CODE
call	CODE
at	CODE
runtime	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
still	CODE
wouldn't	CODE
be	CODE
virtual	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
still	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
class	CODE
name	CODE
there	CODE
virtual	CODE
methods	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
abstract	CODE
ones	CODE
are	CODE
only	CODE
useful	CODE
when	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
which	CODE
at	CODE
runtime	CODE
can	CODE
contain	CODE
many	CODE
different	CODE
types	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
thus	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
method	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
object	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
variable	CODE
with	CODE
static	CODE
methods	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
through	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
name	CODE
anyway	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
exact	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
is	CODE
known	CODE
at	CODE
compile	CODE
time	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
can't	CODE
and	CODE
won't	CODE
change	CODE
thus	CODE

a	CODE

more	CODE
robust	CODE

in	CODE
my	CODE

i	CODE
thought	CODE
i'd	CODE
give	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
shot	CODE
using	CODE

i	CODE
had	CODE
a	CODE

used	CODE
sub-classing	CODE
which	CODE
ended	CODE
up	CODE
having	CODE
way	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
overhead	CODE
i've	CODE
switched	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
flexible	CODE
delegate	CODE
public	CODE
property	CODE
object	CODE
model	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
significantly	CODE
better	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
is	CODE
very	CODE
slightly	CODE
more	CODE
accurate	CODE
i	CODE
wish	CODE
i	CODE
could	CODE
come	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
generate	CODE
months	CODE
ago	CODE
that	CODE
didn't	CODE
seem	CODE
too	CODE
over-engineered	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
i'd	CODE
still	CODE
stick	CODE
with	CODE
jeff's	CODE
if-then	CODE
cascade	CODE
because	CODE
it's	CODE
less	CODE
code	CODE
and	CODE
it's	CODE
simpler	CODE
it's	CODE
definitely	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
ensure	CODE
it'll	CODE
work	CODE
as	CODE
expected	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
below	CODE
code	CODE
printrelativetimegetrelativetimemessagetimespan	CODE

returns	CODE
the	CODE

yesterday	CODE
the	CODE
size	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE

is	CODE
sent	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
content-length	CODE
header	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
urllib	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
returned-urllib-object	CODE
method	CODE
info	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
various	CODE
information	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
retrived	CODE
document	CODE
example	CODE
of	CODE
grabbing	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
google	CODE
logo	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
dict	CODE
so	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
size	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
urllibobjectinfo['content-length']	CODE
and	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
size	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
local	CODE
file	CODE
for	CODE
comparison	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
osstat	CODE
command	CODE
also	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
connecting	CODE
to	CODE
supports	CODE
it	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
etags	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
if-modified-since	CODE
and	CODE
if-none-match	CODE
headers	CODE
using	CODE
these	CODE
will	CODE
take	CODE
advantage	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
webserver's	CODE
caching	CODE

and	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE

osstatst_size	CODE
not	CODE
returning	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
size	CODE
edit	CODE
ok	CODE
i	CODE
figured	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
was	CODE
this	CODE
outputs	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
opening	CODE
both	CODE
files	CODE
for	CODE
binary	CODE
readwrite	CODE
would	CODE
use	CODE
doubletryparse	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
performance	CODE
benefits	CODE
i'd	CODE
personally	CODE
use	CODE
inttryparse	CODE
then	CODE
doubletryparse	CODE
performance	CODE
on	CODE
those	CODE
methods	CODE
is	CODE
quite	CODE
fast	CODE
they	CODE
both	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE
boolean	CODE
if	CODE
both	CODE
fail	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
per	CODE
how	CODE
you	CODE
defined	CODE
your	CODE
data	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
say	CODE
don't	CODE
worry	CODE
so	CODE
much	CODE
about	CODE
such	CODE
micro	CODE
performance	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
much	CODE
better	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
get	CODE
something	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
clear	CODE
and	CODE
concise	CODE
and	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
as	CODE
possible	CODE
the	CODE
worst	CODE
thing	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
is	CODE
sacrifice	CODE
readability	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
insignificant	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
performance	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
performance	CODE
issues	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
save	CODE
them	CODE
for	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
data	CODE
that	CODE
indicates	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
actual	CODE
performance	CODE
problem	CODE
otherwise	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
spend	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
time	CODE
micro-optimizing	CODE
and	CODE
actually	CODE
cause	CODE
higher	CODE
maintenance	CODE
costs	CODE
for	CODE
later	CODE
on	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
find	CODE
this	CODE
parsing	CODE
situation	CODE
is	CODE
really	CODE
the	CODE
bottleneck	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
then	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
to	CODE
try	CODE
and	CODE
figure	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
fastest	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
solve	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
jeff	CODE
and	CODE
many	CODE
others	CODE
have	CODE
blogged	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
thing	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
modification	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
too	CODE
time	CODE
consuming	CODE
meaning	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
purpose	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
background	CODE
thread	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
data	CODE
modification	CODE
try	CODE
moving	CODE
the	CODE
section	CODE
that	CODE
modifies	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
delegate	CODE
and	CODE
invoke'ing	CODE
that	CODE
delegate	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
heavy	CODE
work	CODE
is	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
you'll	CODE
probably	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
deep	CODE
copy	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
data	CODE
to	CODE
pass	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
background	CODE
thread	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
send	CODE
the	CODE
processed	CODE
data	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
ui	CODE
thread	CODE
via	CODE
invoke	CODE
again	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
invokerequired	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
property	CODE
on	CODE

to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
thread	CODE
then	CODE
invoke	CODE
will	CODE
invoke	CODE
the	CODE

on	CODE
the	CODE
correct	CODE
thread	CODE
update	CODE
actually	CODE
at	CODE
my	CODE
last	CODE
job	CODE
we	CODE
did	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
which	CODE
removes	CODE
the	CODE
need	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
else	CODE
block	CODE
and	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
tightens	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
test	CODE
case	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
from	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
guarantee	CODE
this	CODE
solution	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
scenario	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
one	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
update	CODE
progress	CODE
bars	CODE
in	CODE
different	CODE
threads	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
delegate	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
suitable	CODE
here	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
binding	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
by	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
thread	CODE
then	CODE
let	CODE
that	CODE
thread	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
work	CODE
re	CODE
2004	CODE
no	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
only	CODE
move	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
changes	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
delegate	CODE
function	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
change	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
triggers	CODE
the	CODE
control	CODE
update	CODE
other	CODE
than	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
not	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
anything	CODE
extra	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
call	CODE
is	CODE
illegal	CODE
ie	CODE
the	CODE
databind	CODE
call	CODE
affects	CODE
controls	CODE
that	CODE
were	CODE
not	CODE
created	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
thread	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
called	CODE
from	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
delegate	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
even	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
decision	CODE
preparation	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
databind	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
done	CODE
in	CODE

will	CODE

you	CODE
would	CODE
call	CODE
my	CODE
code	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
worker	CODE
thread	CODE
like	CODE
so	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
then	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE

to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE

which	CODE
presuming	CODE

always	CODE
a	CODE

mine	CODE
however	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE

i	CODE
suggest	CODE
you	CODE
stick	CODE

the	CODE

i've	CODE

nunit	CODE

i	CODE
would	CODE
suggest	CODE
this	CODE
even	CODE
when	CODE
working	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

stack	CODE
-	CODE
the	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE

which	CODE
shows	CODE
a	CODE
definite	CODE
movement	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
direction	CODE
to	CODE
allow	CODE
us	CODE
all	CODE
to	CODE
customise	CODE
our	CODE

to	CODE
fit	CODE
i've	CODE
had	CODE
great	CODE
success	CODE
using	CODE
nunit	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
i've	CODE
also	CODE
used	CODE
nmock	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE

an	CODE

used	CODE

also	CODE
i've	CODE
used	CODE
cruise	CODE

check	CODE

we	CODE
use	CODE

they	CODE
prove	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
very	CODE
well	CODE
together	CODE
when	CODE
doing	CODE

you	CODE
will	CODE
almost	CODE
certainly	CODE
need	CODE

do	CODE
some	CODE
form	CODE

while	CODE
this	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE

its	CODE
worth	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
an	CODE

well	CODE

i'm	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
javascript	CODE

but	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
loop	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
elements	CODE
and	CODE
count	CODE
them	CODE
since	CODE
object	CODE
doesn't	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE

@palmsey	CODE
in	CODE
fairness	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
op	CODE
the	CODE
javascript	CODE
docs	CODE
actually	CODE
explicitly	CODE
refer	CODE
to	CODE
using	CODE
variables	CODE
of	CODE
type	CODE
object	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
manner	CODE
as	CODE
associative	CODE
arrays	CODE
here's	CODE
how	CODE
and	CODE
don't	CODE
forget	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
prototype	CODE
chain	CODE
your	CODE
httpservletrequest	CODE
object	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
getparameterstring	CODE
paramname	CODE
method	CODE
that	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
parameter	CODE
values	CODE
httpjavasuncomjavaee5docsapijavaxservletservletrequesthtml#getparameterjavalangstring	CODE

should	CODE
be	CODE

the	CODE

is	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE

is	CODE
sending	CODE
multipart	CODE
mime	CODE
data	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
has	CODE

that	CODE
case	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
the	CODE
byte	CODE
stream	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
mime	CODE
parser	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
or	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
existing	CODE
one	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
apache	CODE
commons	CODE
file	CODE
upload	CODE
api	CODE
well	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
really	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
expert	CODE
opinion	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
usually	CODE
end	CODE
up	CODE
using	CODE
closures	CODE
based	CODE
approach	CODE
just	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
keeps	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
simpler	CODE
to	CODE
manager	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
found	CODE
myself	CODE
using	CODE
prototypes	CODE
for	CODE
methods	CODE
that	CODE
have	CODE
loads	CODE
of	CODE
lines	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
you	CODE
also	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
choice	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
just	CODE
as	CODE
slow	CODE
as	CODE
example	CODE
two	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
more	CODE
like	CODE
javac#	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
more	CODE
explicit	CODE
assigning	CODE
functions	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
prototype	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
for	CODE
public	CODE
methods	CODE
because	CODE
all	CODE
instances	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
class	CODE
will	CODE
share	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
copy	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
assign	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
as	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
example	CODE
every	CODE
time	CODE
you	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
instance	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
creates	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
copy	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
length	CODE
function	CODE
and	CODE
assigns	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
just	CODE
that	CODE
one	CODE
instance	CODE
however	CODE
this	CODE
latter	CODE
technique	CODE
is	CODE
useful	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
each	CODE
copy	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
it's	CODE
own	CODE
copy	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
being	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
privateprivileges	CODE
methods	CODE
which	CODE
have	CODE
access	CODE
to	CODE
private	CODE
variables	CODE
declared	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
and	CODE
inherited	CODE
via	CODE
the	CODE
closure	CODE
mechanism	CODE
douglas	CODE
crockford	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
summary	CODE
fortunately	CODE
i	CODE
get	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
prototypejs	CODE
which	CODE
provides	CODE
some	CODE
nice	CODE
wrappers	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
prototypejs	CODE
documentation	CODE
defining	CODE
classes	CODE
and	CODE
inheritance	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
certain	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
put	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
config	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
encrypt	CODE
the	CODE
config	CODE
file	CODE
update	CODE

use	CODE
it	CODE

[]	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE
problem	CODE
you	CODE

either	CODE

a	CODE

just	CODE
a	CODE

more	CODE

down	CODE
the	CODE

emacs	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
easier	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE

don't	CODE
let	CODE

you	CODE
could	CODE
start	CODE
throwing	CODE
critical	CODE

surely	CODE
an	CODE

will	CODE
catch	CODE
your	CODE
users'	CODE
attention	CODE
outside	CODE
the	CODE
scope	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
question	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
debated	CODE
not	CODE
posting	CODE
this	CODE

in	CODE
java	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
actually	CODE
2	CODE
types	CODE

checked	CODE

unchecked	CODE
the	CODE
basic	CODE
difference	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
much	CODE

in	CODE
c[++]	CODE
you	CODE
dont	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
catch	CODE
an	CODE
unchecked	CODE

for	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE

try	CODE
this	CODE

there	CODE
a	CODE

can	CODE
ensure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE

thrown	CODE
are	CODE
always	CODE
caught	CODE
using	CODE
trycatch	CODE

the	CODE

find	CODE
it	CODE
rather	CODE
funny	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE

chris'	CODE
probably	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
pure	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
however	CODE
i'm	CODE
curious	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
root	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
should	CODE
always	CODE
wrap	CODE
the	CODE
call	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
trycatch	CODE
block	CODE
should	CODE
the	CODE
user-called	CODE
function	CODE
really	CODE
be	CODE
throwing	CODE
exceptions	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
place	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
difficult	CODE
question	CODE
to	CODE
answer	CODE
without	CODE
more	CODE
context	CODE
regarding	CODE
the	CODE
code-base	CODE
in	CODE
question	CODE
shooting	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
hip	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
answer	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
wrap	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
up	CODE
such	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
recommended	CODE
if	CODE
not	CODE
only	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
overall	CODE
exception	CODE
style	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
public	CODE
interface	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
trycatch	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
just	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
ensure	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
no	CODE
unhandled	CODE
exceptions	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
unit	CODE
tests	CODE
and	CODE
code	CODE
review	CODE
are	CODE
probably	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
solution	CODE
firebug	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
well	CODE
unbeatable	CODE
for	CODE
javascript	CODE
development	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
browser	CODE
'alertx'	CODE
was	CODE
the	CODE
primary	CODE
technique	CODE
for	CODE
too	CODE
long	CODE
firebug	CODE
as	CODE
others	CODE
have	CODE
said	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE

improved	CODE

over	CODE
the	CODE
previous	CODE

try	CODE
a	CODE
combination	CODE
of	CODE
script#	CODE
httpwwwnikhilknetscriptsharpintroaspx	CODE
and	CODE
firebug	CODE
cheers	CODE
the	CODE
nightly	CODE
builds	CODE
of	CODE
webkit	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
great	CODE
new	CODE
debugging	CODE
tools	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
findbugs	CODE
and	CODE
jdepend	CODE
integrated	CODE
with	CODE
ant	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
junit	CODE
but	CODE
we're	CODE
not	CODE
using	CODE
any	CODE
coverage	CODE
tool	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
integrated	CODE
to	CODE
rational	CODE
application	CODE
developer	CODE
the	CODE
ide	CODE
i'm	CODE
using	CODE
to	CODE
develop	CODE
j2ee	CODE
applications	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
how	CODE
neat	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
run	CODE
javac	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
windows	CODE
console	CODE
p	CODE
checkstyle	CODE
is	CODE
another	CODE
one	CODE
i've	CODE
used	CODE
at	CODE
a	CODE
previous	CODE
company	CODE
it's	CODE
mainly	CODE
for	CODE
style	CODE
checking	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
some	CODE
static	CODE
analysis	CODE
too	CODE
also	CODE
clover	CODE
for	CODE
code	CODE
coverage	CODE
though	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
free	CODE
tool	CODE
we	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
findbugs	CODE
and	CODE
checkstyle	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
clover	CODE
for	CODE
code	CODE
coverage	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it's	CODE
important	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
static	CODE
analysis	CODE
supporting	CODE
your	CODE
development	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
it's	CODE
still	CODE
not	CODE
widely	CODE
spread	CODE
that	CODE
these	CODE
tools	CODE
are	CODE
important	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
many	CODE
answers	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
about	CODE
new	CODE
tools	CODE
and	CODE
consolidate	CODE
this	CODE
knowledge	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
one	CODE
questionthread	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
doubt	CODE
there	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
1	CODE
true	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
this	CODE
question	CODE
my	CODE
answer	CODE
to	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
question	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
findbugs	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
for	CODE
common	CODE
errors	CODE
badcoding	CODE
-	CODE
run	CODE

also	CODE

our	CODE
coverage	CODE

-	CODE
run	CODE

maven	CODE
hudson	CODE

a	CODE
task-scanner	CODE

display	CODE
a	CODE

show	CODE

they	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE

all	CODE
are	CODE
integrated	CODE
with	CODE

in	CODE
our	CODE

work	CODE
pretty	CODE

well	CODE
-	CODE
though	CODE
after	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
beautiful	CODE
soup	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
see	CODE
why	CODE
this	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
valuable	CODE
tool	CODE
you	CODE
probably	CODE
have	CODE
as	CODE
much	CODE
already	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
for	CODE
perl	CODE
there's	CODE
wwwmechanize	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
hpricot	CODE
on	CODE
ruby	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
snippet	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
retrieve	CODE
all	CODE
book	CODE
titles	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
six	CODE
pages	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
hirethings	CODE
account	CODE
as	CODE
they	CODE
don't	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
provide	CODE
a	CODE
single	CODE
page	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
information	CODE
it's	CODE
pretty	CODE
much	CODE
complete	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
comes	CODE
before	CODE
this	CODE
are	CODE
library	CODE
imports	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
for	CODE
my	CODE
proxy	CODE
beautifulsoup	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
great	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
for	CODE
html	CODE
scraping	CODE
my	CODE
previous	CODE
job	CODE
had	CODE
me	CODE
doing	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
scraping	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
wish	CODE
i	CODE
knew	CODE
about	CODE
beautifulsoup	CODE
when	CODE
i	CODE
started	CODE
it's	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
dom	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
more	CODE
useful	CODE
options	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
more	CODE
pythonic	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
try	CODE
ruby	CODE
they	CODE
ported	CODE
beautifulsoup	CODE
calling	CODE
it	CODE
rubyfulsoup	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
hasn't	CODE
been	CODE
updated	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
while	CODE
other	CODE
useful	CODE
tools	CODE
are	CODE
htmlparser	CODE
or	CODE
sgmllibsgmlparser	CODE
which	CODE
are	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
python	CODE
library	CODE
these	CODE
work	CODE
by	CODE
calling	CODE
methods	CODE
every	CODE
time	CODE
you	CODE
enterexit	CODE
a	CODE
tag	CODE
and	CODE
encounter	CODE
html	CODE
text	CODE
they're	CODE
like	CODE
expat	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
familiar	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
these	CODE
libraries	CODE
are	CODE
especially	CODE
useful	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
very	CODE
large	CODE
files	CODE
and	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
dom	CODE
tree	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
long	CODE
and	CODE
expensive	CODE
regular	CODE
expressions	CODE
aren't	CODE
very	CODE
necessary	CODE
beautifulsoup	CODE
handles	CODE
regular	CODE
expressions	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
their	CODE
power	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
utilize	CODE
it	CODE
there	CODE
i	CODE
say	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
beautifulsoup	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
speed	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
smaller	CODE
memory	CODE
footprint	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
find	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
html	CODE
parser	CODE
on	CODE
python	CODE
let	CODE
me	CODE
know	CODE
i	CODE
found	CODE
htmlsql	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
ridiculously	CODE
simple	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
screenscrape	CODE
it	CODE
takes	CODE
literally	CODE
minutes	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
results	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
the	CODE
queries	CODE
are	CODE
super-intuitive	CODE
-	CODE
like	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
now	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
alternatives	CODE
that	CODE
take	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
approach	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
world	CODE
i	CODE
recommend	CODE
the	CODE
html	CODE
agility	CODE
pack	CODE
not	CODE
near	CODE
as	CODE
simple	CODE
as	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
options	CODE
like	CODE
htmlsql	CODE
but	CODE
it's	CODE
very	CODE
flexible	CODE
it	CODE
lets	CODE
you	CODE
maniuplate	CODE
poorly	CODE
formed	CODE
html	CODE
as	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
were	CODE
well	CODE
formed	CODE
xml	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
xpath	CODE
or	CODE
just	CODE
itereate	CODE
over	CODE
nodes	CODE
sounds	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
like	CODE
you're	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
combine	CODE
things	CODE
that	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
be	CODE
combined	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
different	CODE
processing	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
view	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
or	CODE
group	CODE
object	CODE
you're	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
use	CODE
two	CODE
different	CODE
view	CODE
functions	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

common	CODE
idioms	CODE
you'd	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
extract	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
object_detail	CODE
type	CODE

perhaps	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
decorator	CODE
or	CODE
just	CODE
helper	CODE
functions	CODE
-dan	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
simply	CODE
displaying	CODE
data	CODE
from	CODE
models	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
django	CODE
generic	CODE
views	CODE
they're	CODE
designed	CODE
to	CODE
let	CODE
you	CODE
easy	CODE
show	CODE
data	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
model	CODE
without	CODE
having	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
view	CODE
and	CODE
stuff	CODE
about	CODE
mapping	CODE
url	CODE
paramaters	CODE
to	CODE
views	CODE
fetching	CODE
data	CODE
handling	CODE
edge	CODE
cases	CODE
rendering	CODE
output	CODE
etc	CODE
try	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
div	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
tag	CODE
soup	CODE
html	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
innerhtml	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
div	CODE
the	CODE
browser	CODE
should	CODE
process	CODE
that	CODE
into	CODE
xml	CODE
which	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
parse	CODE
the	CODE
innerhtml	CODE
property	CODE
takes	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
that	CODE
specifies	CODE
a	CODE
valid	CODE
combination	CODE
of	CODE
text	CODE
and	CODE
elements	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
innerhtml	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
given	CODE
string	CODE
completely	CODE
replaces	CODE
the	CODE
existing	CODE
content	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
contains	CODE
html	CODE
tags	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
is	CODE
parsed	CODE
and	CODE
formatted	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
placed	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
document	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
download	CODE
a	CODE
webpage	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
xml	CODE
object	CODE
using	CODE
javascript	CODE
but	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
webpage	CODE
since	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
no	CODE
control	CODE
over	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
will	CODE
do	CODE
closing	CODE
tabs	CODE
or	CODE
windows	CODE
or	CODE
whatnot	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
osx	CODE
dashboard	CODE
widget	CODE
or	CODE
some	CODE
separate	CODE
application	CODE
a	CODE
firefox	CODE
extension	CODE
would	CODE
also	CODE
work	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
worry	CODE
about	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
closing	CODE
the	CODE

ajaxian	CODE
actually	CODE
had	CODE
a	CODE
post	CODE
on	CODE

from	CODE
an	CODE

today	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
probably	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
js	CODE
snippet	CODE
they	CODE
have	CODE
posted	CODE
there	CODE
as	CODE
for	CODE
handling	CODE
closing	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE
attach	CODE

the	CODE

do	CODE
whatever	CODE
you	CODE

probably	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE

the	CODE

if	CODE
you're	CODE

it's	CODE
probably	CODE
already	CODE

a	CODE

example	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
language	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
using	CODE
has	CODE

just	CODE
use	CODE
that	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE
c#	CODE

method	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE

you	CODE

do	CODE
something	CODE

the	CODE
following	CODE
read	CODE

take	CODE
the	CODE

capitalize	CODE
the	CODE

exit	CODE

capitalize	CODE
it	CODE

subtract	CODE

there	CODE
would	CODE
need	CODE

be	CODE
much	CODE
more	CODE
error	CODE
checking	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
ensuring	CODE
valid	CODE
letters	CODE
etc	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
capitalize	CODE

will	CODE
need	CODE

impose	CODE
some	CODE

httpfrankschmittorgprojectstitle-case	CODE

a	CODE
ruby	CODE
one-liner	CODE
solution	CODE
httpsnippetsdzonecompostsshow4702	CODE
what	CODE
the	CODE
one-liner	CODE
is	CODE
doing	CODE
is	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
regular	CODE

substitution	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
character	CODE
of	CODE
each	CODE
word	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE

it	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
wary	CODE
of	CODE
automatically	CODE
upcasing	CODE
all	CODE
whitespace-preceded-words	CODE
in	CODE
scenarios	CODE
where	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
risk	CODE
of	CODE
attracting	CODE
the	CODE
fury	CODE
of	CODE
nitpickers	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
consider	CODE
implementing	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
for	CODE
exception	CODE
cases	CODE
like	CODE
articles	CODE
and	CODE
conjunctions	CODE
behold	CODE

and	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
comes	CODE

proper	CODE

the	CODE
thing	CODE
gets	CODE
much	CODE
uglier	CODE
looking	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
registry	CODE
is	CODE
perfectly	CODE
valid	CODE
so	CODE
long	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
sure	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE

the	CODE

will	CODE
always	CODE

how	CODE
to	CODE
detect	CODE
programmatically	CODE
whether	CODE
you	CODE

here's	CODE
the	CODE

the	CODE

but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE

you	CODE
should	CODE
ask	CODE
the	CODE

to	CODE
determine	CODE
this	CODE
via	CODE
the	CODE

api's	CODE
not	CODE
by	CODE

ask	CODE
yourself	CODE
the	CODE
questions	CODE
1	CODE
-	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
registry	CODE
entry	CODE
concerned	CODE
properly	CODE
documented	CODE
by	CODE

2	CODE
-	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
do	CODE
they	CODE
provide	CODE
a	CODE
definitive	CODE
list	CODE

possible	CODE
values	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
guaranteed	CODE
to	CODE
permit	CODE
you	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE

whether	CODE
you	CODE

running	CODE
32	CODE

64	CODE
bit	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE

yeah	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
but	CODE
more	CODE
long	CODE
winded	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
documented	CODE
and	CODE
definitive	CODE
the	CODE
easiest	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
test	CODE
for	CODE
64-bit	CODE
under	CODE
net	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
intptrsize	CODE
edit	CODE
doh	CODE
this	CODE
will	CODE
tell	CODE
you	CODE
whether	CODE

not	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
process	CODE
is	CODE
64-bit	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE

as	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
sorry	CODE
the	CODE
easiest	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
test	CODE
for	CODE
64-bit	CODE
under	CODE
net	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE

i	CODE
believe	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
intptrsize	CODE
is	CODE
4	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
32bit	CODE
app	CODE
that's	CODE
running	CODE
under	CODE
wow	CODE
isn't	CODE
it	CODE
edit	CODE
@edit	CODE
yeah	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
reflection	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
and	CODE
invoke	CODE
it	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
assuming	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
that	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
property	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
theobject	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
prototype	CODE
function	CODE
and	CODE
so	CODE
on	CODE
not	CODE
really	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
reflection	CODE
to	CODE
achieve	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
won't	CODE
be	CODE
nearly	CODE
as	CODE
simple	CODE
as	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
wanted	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
the	CODE
private	CODE
field	CODE
of	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
function	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
c#	CODE
isn't	CODE
a	CODE
dynamic	CODE
language	CODE
like	CODE
that	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
however	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
c#	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
file	CODE
full	CODE
with	CODE
class	CODE
and	CODE
everything	CODE
and	CODE
run	CODE
it	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
codedom	CODE
provider	CODE
for	CODE
c#	CODE
and	CODE
compile	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
assembly	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
execute	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
forum	CODE
post	CODE
on	CODE
msdn	CODE
contains	CODE
an	CODE
answer	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
example	CODE
code	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
page	CODE
somewhat	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
anonymous	CODE
method	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
hardly	CODE
say	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
very	CODE
good	CODE
solution	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
possible	CODE
anyway	CODE
what	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
are	CODE
you	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
expect	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
string	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
minor	CODE
subset	CODE
of	CODE
valid	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
instance	CODE
just	CODE
math	CODE
expressions	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
that	CODE
other	CODE
alternatives	CODE
exists	CODE
edit	CODE
well	CODE
that	CODE
teaches	CODE
me	CODE
to	CODE
read	CODE
the	CODE
questions	CODE
thoroughly	CODE
first	CODE
yes	CODE
reflection	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
some	CODE
help	CODE
here	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
split	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
individual	CODE
properties	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
propertyinfo	CODE
object	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
property	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
use	CODE
that	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
manipulate	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
object	CODE
link	CODE
propertyinfosetvalue	CODE
method	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
definitely	CODE
work	CODE
personally	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
particular	CODE
problem	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
probably	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
different	CODE
approach	CODE
maybe	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
when	CODE
using	CODE
patterns	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
careful	CODE
that	CODE
your	CODE
data	CODE
is	CODE
stored	CODE
by	CODE
reference	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
by	CODE
value	CODE
in	CODE
other	CODE
words	CODE
don't	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
with	CODE
primitives	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
their	CODE
big	CODE
bloated	CODE
class	CODE
counterparts	CODE
i	CODE
realized	CODE
that's	CODE
not	CODE
exactly	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
question	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
pretty	CODE
well	CODE
answered	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
thought	CODE
maybe	CODE
an	CODE
alternative	CODE
approach	CODE
might	CODE
help	CODE

here	CODE
so	CODE
microsoft	CODE
dropped	CODE

no	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
killers	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
with	CODE

in	CODE
the	CODE

is	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
support	CODE
for	CODE
referencing	CODE
web	CODE
services	CODE
that	CODE
alone	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
deter	CODE
me	CODE
from	CODE
it	CODE
ever	CODE
since	CODE
c#	CODE
syntax	CODE
is	CODE
so	CODE
close	CODE
to	CODE
java	CODE
and	CODE
better	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
ways	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
learn	CODE
c#	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
j#	CODE
and	CODE
since	CODE
c#	CODE
is	CODE
more	CODE
widely	CODE
used	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
easily	CODE
find	CODE
java	CODE
--	CODE
c#	CODE

on	CODE
google	CODE

check	CODE
out	CODE

watch	CODE
some	CODE

no	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
many	CODE

built	CODE

vs2005	CODE
that	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
support	CODE
windows	CODE
xp	CODE
2000	CODE
nt	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE
stack	CODE
the	CODE
issue	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
by	CODE
default	CODE
vs2005	CODE
wants	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
librariesexports	CODE
not	CODE
present	CODE
on	CODE
nt	CODE
see	CODE
this	CODE
thread	CODE
for	CODE
some	CODE
background	CODE
then	CODE
start	CODE
limiting	CODE
your	CODE
dependencies	CODE
via	CODE
preprocessor	CODE
macros	CODE
and	CODE
avoiding	CODE
apis	CODE
which	CODE
aren't	CODE
supported	CODE
on	CODE
nt	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
suggest	CODE
storing	CODE
the	CODE
stylesheet	CODE
selection	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
session	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
rely	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE

key	CODE
being	CODE
present	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE
check	CODE
the	CODE

in	CODE
page_load	CODE
and	CODE
add	CODE
the	CODE
appropriate	CODE
stylesheet	CODE
reference	CODE
it	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
temporarydevelopment	CODE
situation	CODE
so	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
whatever	CODE
is	CODE
easy	CODE
and	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE

you	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE

they	CODE
also	CODE
allow	CODE

give	CODE

a	CODE

i	CODE
would	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
wwwwebsitecomstylesheet=newcss	CODE
then	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE

patrick's	CODE
solution	CODE
is	CODE
probably	CODE
the	CODE
cleanest	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
dynamically	CODE
pick	CODE
up	CODE
the	CODE
module	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
import	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
filehelpers	CODE
open	CODE
source	CODE
library	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
simple	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
open	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
read	CODE
each	CODE
line	CODE
into	CODE
an	CODE
array	CODE
linked	CODE
list	CODE
data-structure-of-your-choice	CODE
be	CODE
careful	CODE
about	CODE
handling	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
line	CODE
though	CODE
this	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
over	CODE
your	CODE
head	CODE
but	CODE
there	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
direct	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
access	CODE
them	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
connection	CODE
string	CODE
why	CODE
not	CODE
try	CODE
using	CODE
python	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
c#	CODE
or	CODE
vb	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
csv	CODE
module	CODE
to	CODE
import	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
heavy	CODE
lifting	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
guarantee	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
no	CODE
commas	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
simplest	CODE
way	CODE
would	CODE
probably	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
stringsplit	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
there	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
libraries	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
help	CODE
but	CODE
that's	CODE
probably	CODE
as	CODE
simple	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
get	CODE
just	CODE
make	CODE
sure	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
have	CODE
commas	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
otherwise	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
it	CODE
better	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
two	CODE
articles	CODE
on	CODE
codeproject	CODE
that	CODE
provide	CODE
code	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
solution	CODE
one	CODE
that	CODE
uses	CODE
streamreader	CODE
and	CODE
one	CODE
that	CODE
imports	CODE
csv	CODE
data	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
text	CODE
driver	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
bored	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
modified	CODE
some	CODE
stuff	CODE
i	CODE
wrote	CODE
it	CODE
try's	CODE
to	CODE
encapsulate	CODE
the	CODE
parsing	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
oo	CODE
manner	CODE
whle	CODE
cutting	CODE
down	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
iterations	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
it	CODE
only	CODE
iterates	CODE
once	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
top	CODE
foreach	CODE
brian	CODE
gives	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
solution	CODE
for	CODE
converting	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
strongly	CODE
typed	CODE
collection	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
csv	CODE
parsing	CODE
methods	CODE
given	CODE
don't	CODE
take	CODE
into	CODE

escaping	CODE

some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
subtleties	CODE
of	CODE
csv	CODE
files	CODE
like	CODE
trimming	CODE
fields	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
i	CODE
personally	CODE
use	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
rough	CODE
around	CODE
the	CODE
edges	CODE
and	CODE
has	CODE
pretty	CODE
much	CODE
no	CODE
error	CODE
reporting	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
this	CODE
doesn't	CODE
handle	CODE
the	CODE

meerley	CODE
having	CODE
a	CODE

inside	CODE

it	CODE
see	CODE
this	CODE
post	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
better	CODE
expanation	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
some	CODE
links	CODE
to	CODE
some	CODE
proper	CODE
libraries	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
an	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
which	CODE
requires	CODE
net	CODE
35	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
static	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
static	CODE
class	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
parameter	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
needs	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
prefixed	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
signature	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
then	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
can't	CODE
dynamically	CODE
add	CODE
methods	CODE
to	CODE
existing	CODE
objects	CODE
or	CODE
classes	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
except	CODE
by	CODE
changing	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
class	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
however	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
30	CODE
use	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
which	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
new	CODE
methods	CODE
but	CODE
are	CODE
compile-time	CODE
magic	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
method	CODE
but	CODE
will	CODE
compile	CODE
the	CODE
exact	CODE
same	CODE
way	CODE
as	CODE
this	CODE
code	CODE
what	CODE
exactly	CODE
are	CODE
you	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
accomplish	CODE
perhaps	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
better	CODE
ways	CODE
of	CODE
doing	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
35	CODE
compiler	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
an	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
clr	CODE
20	CODE
targeted	CODE
project	CODE
35	CODE
compiler	CODE
by	CODE
including	CODE
this	CODE
hack	CODE
it	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
you're	CODE
talking	CODE
about	CODE
c#'s	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
you	CODE
add	CODE
functionality	CODE
to	CODE
existing	CODE
classes	CODE
by	CODE
inserting	CODE
the	CODE
this	CODE
keyword	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
parameter	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
static	CODE
method	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
static	CODE
class	CODE
strings	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
already	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
trim	CODE
method	CODE
so	CODE
i'll	CODE
use	CODE
another	CODE
examplepublic	CODE
static	CODE
class	CODE
mystringetensions	CODE
{	CODE
public	CODE
static	CODE
bool	CODE
containsmabsterthis	CODE
string	CODE
s	CODE
{	CODE
return	CODE
scontainsmabster	CODE
}	CODE
}	CODE
so	CODE
now	CODE
every	CODE
string	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
tremendously	CODE
useful	CODE
containsmabster	CODE
method	CODE
which	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
like	CODE
thisif	CODE
why	CODE
hello	CODE
there	CODE
mabstercontainsmabster	CODE
{	CODE
*	CODE
*	CODE
}	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
also	CODE
add	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
to	CODE
interfaces	CODE
eg	CODE
ilist	CODE
which	CODE
means	CODE
that	CODE
any	CODE
class	CODE
implementing	CODE
that	CODE
interface	CODE
will	CODE
also	CODE
pick	CODE
up	CODE
that	CODE
new	CODE
method	CODE
any	CODE
extra	CODE
parameters	CODE
you	CODE
declare	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
after	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
this	CODE
parameter	CODE
are	CODE
treated	CODE
as	CODE
normal	CODE
parameters	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
java	CODE
developer	CODE
but	CODE
just	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
sound	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
an	CODE
illegalargumentexception	CODE
is	CODE
called	CODE
for	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
null	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
an	CODE
allowed	CODE
value	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
nullpointerexception	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
thrown	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
variable	CODE
that	CODE
turns	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
null	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
setter	CODE
method	CODE
and	CODE
null	CODE
is	CODE
being	CODE
passed	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
make	CODE
more	CODE
sense	CODE
to	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
illegalargumentexception	CODE
a	CODE
nullpointerexception	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
more	CODE
sense	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
case	CODE
where	CODE
you're	CODE
attempting	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
null	CODE
so	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
it's	CODE
null	CODE
nullpointer	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
being	CODE
passed	CODE
in	CODE
and	CODE
it's	CODE
null	CODE
illegalargument	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
definitely	CODE
throw	CODE
a	CODE
illegalargumentexception	CODE
and	CODE
thus	CODE
fail-fast	CODE
let	CODE
other	CODE
developers	CODE
know	CODE
by	CODE
marking	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
javadocs	CODE
and	CODE
also	CODE
define	CODE
constraints	CODE
on	CODE
your	CODE
methods	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
see	CODE
what	CODE
happens	CODE
when	CODE
they	CODE
pass	CODE
an	CODE
invalid	CODE
objects	CODE
i	CODE
wrote	CODE
about	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
weeks	CODE
ago	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
follow	CODE
up	CODE
i	CODE
tend	CODE
to	CODE
follow	CODE
the	CODE
design	CODE
of	CODE
jdk	CODE
libraries	CODE
especially	CODE
collections	CODE
and	CODE
concurrency	CODE
joshua	CODE
bloch	CODE
doug	CODE
lea	CODE
those	CODE
guys	CODE
know	CODE
how	CODE
to	CODE
design	CODE
solid	CODE
apis	CODE
anyway	CODE
many	CODE
apis	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
jdk	CODE
pro-actively	CODE
throws	CODE
nullpointerexception	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
the	CODE
javadoc	CODE
for	CODE
mapcontainskey	CODE
states	CODE
@throws	CODE
nullpointerexception	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
is	CODE
null	CODE
and	CODE
this	CODE
map	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
permit	CODE
null	CODE
keys	CODE
optional	CODE
it's	CODE
perfectly	CODE
valid	CODE
to	CODE
throw	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
npe	CODE
the	CODE
convention	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
include	CODE
the	CODE
parameter	CODE
name	CODE
which	CODE
was	CODE
null	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
message	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
exception	CODE
the	CODE
pattern	CODE
goes	CODE
whatever	CODE
you	CODE
do	CODE
don't	CODE
allow	CODE
a	CODE
bad	CODE
value	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
set	CODE
and	CODE
throw	CODE
an	CODE
exception	CODE
later	CODE
when	CODE
other	CODE
code	CODE
attempts	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
that	CODE
makes	CODE
debugging	CODE
a	CODE
nightmare	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
always	CODE
the	CODE
follow	CODE
the	CODE
fail-fast	CODE
principle	CODE
i've	CODE
tried	CODE
finding	CODE
the	CODE
ultimate	CODE
compiler	CODE
call	CODE
earlier	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
gave	CODE
up	CODE
there's	CODE
quite	CODE
a	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
layers	CODE
of	CODE
interfaces	CODE
and	CODE
virtual	CODE
classes	CODE
for	CODE
my	CODE
patience	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
source	CODE
reader	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
ends	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
dom	CODE
tree	CODE
but	CODE
intuitively	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
agree	CODE
with	CODE
you	CODE
the	CODE
work	CODE
necessary	CODE
to	CODE
transform	CODE
the	CODE
dom	CODE
to	CODE
il	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
much	CODE
less	CODE
than	CODE
reading	CODE
c#	CODE
source	CODE
code	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
pure	CODE
csshtml	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
achieve	CODE
this	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
your	CODE
best	CODE
bet	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
in	CODE
pre-processing	CODE
if	CODE
list	CODE
length	CODE
>	CODE
150	CODE
split	CODE
into	CODE
3	CODE
columns	CODE
esle	CODE
if	CODE
>	CODE
70	CODE
split	CODE
into	CODE
2	CODE
columns	CODE
else	CODE
1	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
option	CODE
using	CODE
javascript	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
familiar	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
jquery	CODE
library	CODE
specifically	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
iterate	CODE
through	CODE
lists	CODE
probably	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
them	CODE
being	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
class	CODE
count	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
children	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
high	CODE
enough	CODE
number	CODE
dynamically	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
list	CODE
after	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
transferring	CODE
some	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
list	CODE
items	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
new	CODE
list	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
implementing	CODE
the	CODE
columns	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
probably	CODE
float	CODE
them	CODE
left	CODE
followed	CODE
by	CODE
an	CODE
element	CODE
that	CODE
had	CODE
the	CODE
style	CODE
clearleft	CODE
or	CODE
clearboth	CODE
css	CODE
ulcolumn	CODE
{	CODE
floatleft	CODE
width50%	CODE
}	CODE
divclear	CODE
{	CODE
clearboth	CODE
}	CODE
html	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
dug	CODE
up	CODE
this	CODE
article	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
apart	CODE
css	CODE
swag	CODE
multi-column	CODE
lists	CODE
i	CODE
ended	CODE
up	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
solution	CODE
it's	CODE
not	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
but	CODE
the	CODE
others	CODE
require	CODE
either	CODE
using	CODE
complex	CODE
html	CODE
that	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
generated	CODE
dynamically	CODE
or	CODE
creating	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
custom	CODE
classes	CODE
which	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
but	CODE
would	CODE
require	CODE
loads	CODE
of	CODE
in-line	CODE
styling	CODE
and	CODE
possibly	CODE
a	CODE
huge	CODE
page	CODE
other	CODE
solutions	CODE
are	CODE
still	CODE
welcome	CODE
though	CODE
if	CODE
safari	CODE
and	CODE
firefox	CODE
support	CODE
is	CODE
good	CODE
enough	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
css	CODE
solution	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
about	CODE
opera	CODE
yes	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
try	CODE
it	CODE
out	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
test	CODE
you	CODE
will	CODE
see	CODE
long	CODE
printed	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
widening	CODE
because	CODE
java	CODE
will	CODE
choose	CODE
to	CODE
widen	CODE
the	CODE
int	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
long	CODE
before	CODE
it	CODE
chooses	CODE
to	CODE
autobox	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
an	CODE
integer	CODE
so	CODE
the	CODE
hellolong	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
chosen	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
called	CODE
edit	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
post	CODE
being	CODE
referenced	CODE
further	CODE
edit	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
option	CODE
would	CODE
print	CODE
integer	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
widening	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
larger	CODE
primitive	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
option	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
must	CODE
box	CODE
it	CODE
up	CODE
thus	CODE
integer	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
option	CODE
furthermore	CODE
java	CODE
will	CODE
only	CODE
autobox	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
original	CODE
type	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
give	CODE
a	CODE
compiler	CODE
error	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
leave	CODE
the	CODE
hellolong	CODE
and	CODE
removed	CODE
hellointeger	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
case	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
widening	CODE
conversion	CODE
happening	CODE
this	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
see	CODE
when	CODE
runinng	CODE
the	CODE
javap	CODE
utility	CODE
program	CODE
included	CODE
w	CODE
the	CODE
jdk	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
compiled	CODE
class	CODE
clearly	CODE
you	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
i2l	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
mnemonic	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
widening	CODE
integer-to-long	CODE
bytecode	CODE
instruction	CODE
see	CODE
reference	CODE
here	CODE
and	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
case	CODE
replacing	CODE
the	CODE
long	CODE
x	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
object	CODE
long	CODE
x	CODE
signature	CODE
you'll	CODE
have	CODE
this	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
method	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
see	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
has	CODE
created	CODE
the	CODE
instruction	CODE
integervalueofint	CODE
to	CODE
box	CODE
the	CODE
primitive	CODE
inside	CODE
the	CODE
wrapper	CODE
another	CODE
interesting	CODE
thing	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
example	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
method	CODE
overloading	CODE
the	CODE
combination	CODE
of	CODE
type	CODE
widening	CODE
and	CODE
method	CODE
overloading	CODE
only	CODE
working	CODE
because	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
decision	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
method	CODE
to	CODE
choose	CODE
consider	CODE
the	CODE
following	CODE
example	CODE
it	CODE
doesn't	CODE

that	CODE
explains	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
basics	CODE
through	CODE
example	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
think	CODE
pointers	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
concept	CODE
are	CODE
particularly	CODE
tricky	CODE
-	CODE
most	CODE
students'	CODE
mental	CODE
models	CODE
map	CODE
to	CODE
something	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
and	CODE
some	CODE
quick	CODE
box	CODE
sketches	CODE
can	CODE
help	CODE
the	CODE
difficulty	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
that	CODE
which	CODE
i've	CODE
experienced	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
past	CODE
and	CODE
seen	CODE
others	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
management	CODE
of	CODE
pointers	CODE
in	CODE
cc++	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
unncessarily	CODE
convoluted	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
see	CODE
what	CODE
is	CODE
so	CODE
confusing	CODE
about	CODE
pointers	CODE
they	CODE
point	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
location	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
it	CODE
stores	CODE
the	CODE
memory	CODE
address	CODE
in	CODE
cc++	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
specify	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
the	CODE
pointer	CODE
points	CODE
to	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
says	CODE
that	CODE
my_int_pointer	CODE
contains	CODE
the	CODE
address	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
location	CODE
that	CODE
contains	CODE
an	CODE
int	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
with	CODE
pointers	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
point	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
location	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
trail	CODE
off	CODE
into	CODE
some	CODE
location	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
in	CODE
as	CODE
proof	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
numerous	CODE
security	CODE
holes	CODE
in	CODE
cc++	CODE
applications	CODE
from	CODE
buffer	CODE
overflow	CODE
incrementing	CODE
the	CODE
pointer	CODE
past	CODE
the	CODE
allocated	CODE
boundary	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
pointers	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
confuse	CODE
so	CODE
many	CODE
people	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
mostly	CODE
come	CODE
with	CODE
little	CODE
or	CODE
no	CODE
background	CODE
in	CODE
computer	CODE
architecture	CODE
since	CODE
many	CODE
don't	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
have	CODE
an	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
how	CODE
computers	CODE
the	CODE
machine	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
implemented	CODE
-	CODE
working	CODE
in	CODE
cc++	CODE
seems	CODE
alien	CODE
a	CODE
drill	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
ask	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
implement	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
bytecode	CODE
based	CODE
virtual	CODE
machine	CODE
in	CODE
any	CODE
language	CODE
they	CODE
chose	CODE
python	CODE
works	CODE
great	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
with	CODE
an	CODE
instruction	CODE
set	CODE
focussed	CODE
on	CODE
pointer	CODE
operations	CODE
load	CODE
store	CODE
directindirect	CODE
addressing	CODE
then	CODE
ask	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
write	CODE
simple	CODE
programs	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
instruction	CODE
set	CODE
anything	CODE
requiring	CODE
slightly	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
simple	CODE
addition	CODE
is	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
involve	CODE
pointers	CODE
and	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
sure	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
main	CODE
reason	CODE
that	CODE
people	CODE
have	CODE
trouble	CODE
with	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
it's	CODE
generally	CODE
not	CODE
taught	CODE
in	CODE
an	CODE
interesting	CODE
and	CODE
engaging	CODE
manner	CODE
i'd	CODE
like	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
a	CODE
lecturer	CODE
get	CODE
10	CODE
volunteers	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
crowd	CODE
and	CODE
give	CODE
them	CODE
a	CODE
1	CODE
meter	CODE
ruler	CODE
each	CODE
get	CODE
them	CODE
to	CODE
stand	CODE
around	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
configuration	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
rulers	CODE
to	CODE
point	CODE
at	CODE
each	CODE
other	CODE
then	CODE
show	CODE
pointer	CODE
arithmetic	CODE
by	CODE
moving	CODE
people	CODE
around	CODE
and	CODE
where	CODE
they	CODE
point	CODE
their	CODE
rulers	CODE
it'd	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
but	CODE
effective	CODE
and	CODE
above	CODE
all	CODE
memorable	CODE
way	CODE
of	CODE
showing	CODE
the	CODE
concepts	CODE
without	CODE
getting	CODE
too	CODE
bogged	CODE
down	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
mechanics	CODE
once	CODE
you	CODE
get	CODE
to	CODE
c	CODE
and	CODE
c++	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
harder	CODE
for	CODE
some	CODE
people	CODE
i'm	CODE
not	CODE
sure	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
finally	CODE
putting	CODE
theory	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
don't	CODE
properly	CODE
grasp	CODE
into	CODE
practice	CODE
or	CODE
because	CODE
pointer	CODE
manipulation	CODE
is	CODE
inherently	CODE
harder	CODE
in	CODE
those	CODE
languages	CODE
i	CODE
can't	CODE
remember	CODE
my	CODE
own	CODE
transition	CODE
that	CODE
well	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
knew	CODE
pointers	CODE
in	CODE
pascal	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
moved	CODE
to	CODE
c	CODE
and	CODE
got	CODE
totally	CODE
lost	CODE
pointers	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
concept	CODE
that	CODE
for	CODE
many	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
confusing	CODE
at	CODE
first	CODE
in	CODE
particular	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
comes	CODE
to	CODE
copying	CODE
pointer	CODE
values	CODE
around	CODE
and	CODE
still	CODE
referencing	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
memory	CODE
block	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
analogy	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
consider	CODE
the	CODE
pointer	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
piece	CODE
of	CODE
paper	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
house	CODE
address	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
memory	CODE
block	CODE
it	CODE
references	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
house	CODE
all	CODE
sorts	CODE
of	CODE
operations	CODE
can	CODE
thus	CODE
be	CODE
easily	CODE
explained	CODE
i've	CODE
added	CODE
some	CODE
delphi	CODE
code	CODE
down	CODE
below	CODE
and	CODE
some	CODE
comments	CODE
where	CODE
appropriate	CODE
i	CODE
chose	CODE
delphi	CODE
since	CODE
my	CODE
other	CODE
main	CODE
programming	CODE
language	CODE
c#	CODE
does	CODE
not	CODE
exhibit	CODE
things	CODE
like	CODE
memory	CODE
leaks	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
way	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
only	CODE
wish	CODE
to	CODE
learn	CODE
the	CODE
high-level	CODE
concept	CODE
of	CODE
pointers	CODE
then	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
ignore	CODE
the	CODE
parts	CODE
labelled	CODE
memory	CODE
layout	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
explanation	CODE
below	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
intended	CODE
to	CODE
give	CODE
examples	CODE
of	CODE
what	CODE
memory	CODE
could	CODE
look	CODE
like	CODE
after	CODE
operations	CODE
but	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
low-level	CODE
in	CODE
nature	CODE
however	CODE
in	CODE
order	CODE
to	CODE
accurately	CODE
explain	CODE
how	CODE
buffer	CODE
overruns	CODE
really	CODE
work	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
important	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
added	CODE
these	CODE
diagrams	CODE
disclaimer	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
intents	CODE
and	CODE
purposes	CODE
this	CODE
explanation	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
memory	CODE
layouts	CODE
are	CODE
vastly	CODE
simplified	CODE
there's	CODE
more	CODE
overhead	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
more	CODE
details	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
memory	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
low-level	CODE
basis	CODE
however	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
intents	CODE
of	CODE
explaining	CODE
memory	CODE
and	CODE
pointers	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
accurate	CODE
enough	CODE
let's	CODE
assume	CODE
the	CODE
thouse	CODE
class	CODE
used	CODE
below	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
initialize	CODE
the	CODE
house	CODE
object	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
given	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
constructor	CODE
is	CODE
copied	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE

there	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
reason	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
defined	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
fixed-size	CODE
array	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
there	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
some	CODE
overhead	CODE
associated	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
house	CODE

i'll	CODE

the	CODE

there	CODE
will	CODE
typically	CODE
be	CODE
more	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
various	CODE
types	CODE
of	CODE

the	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
delegate	CODE
type	CODE
to	CODE
simplify	CODE
simon's	CODE
code	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
built	CODE
in	CODE
generic	CODE
action	CODE
delegate	CODE
it	CODE
saves	CODE
peppering	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
bunch	CODE
of	CODE
delegate	CODE
types	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
really	CODE
need	CODE
also	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
35	CODE
they	CODE
added	CODE
a	CODE
params	CODE
parameter	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
invoke	CODE
method	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
define	CODE
a	CODE
temporary	CODE
array	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
browserplus	CODE
project	CODE
at	CODE
yahoo	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
they	CODE
have	CODE
built	CODE
a	CODE
toolkit	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
gritty	CODE
work	CODE
of	CODE
writing	CODE
the	CODE
browser	CODE
plugin	CODE
yourself	CODE
have	CODE
you	CODE
tried	CODE
watching	CODE
the	CODE
traffic	CODE
between	CODE
the	CODE
gui	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
port	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
some	CODE
kind	CODE
of	CODE
special	CODE
command	CODE
being	CODE
sent	CODE
across	CODE
also	CODE
just	CODE
curious	CODE
python	CODE
is	CODE
sending	CODE
ascii	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
utf-8	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
else	CODE
right	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
i	CODE
ask	CODE
is	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
noticed	CODE
your	CODE
quote	CODE
changes	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
strings	CODE
and	CODE
in	CODE
some	CODE
languages	CODE
that	CODE
actually	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
between	CODE
ascii	CODE
and	CODE
utf-8	CODE
devcuxxxxx	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
callout	CODE
device	CODE
it's	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
establish	CODE
a	CODE
connection	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
serial	CODE
device	CODE
and	CODE
start	CODE
talking	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
devttyxxxxx	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
dialin	CODE
device	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
monitoring	CODE
a	CODE
port	CODE
for	CODE
incoming	CODE
calls	CODE
for	CODE
eg	CODE
a	CODE
fax	CODE
listener	CODE
many	CODE
years	CODE
ago	CODE
to	CODE
provide	CODE
an	CODE
age	CODE
calculator	CODE
gimmick	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
website	CODE
i	CODE
wrote	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
calculate	CODE
age	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
fraction	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
port	CODE
of	CODE
that	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
c#	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
php	CODE
version	CODE
i'm	CODE
afraid	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
been	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
test	CODE
the	CODE
c#	CODE
version	CODE
but	CODE
hope	CODE
you	CODE
enjoy	CODE
all	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
admittedly	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
gimmicky	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
purposes	CODE
of	CODE
showing	CODE
user	CODE
profiles	CODE
on	CODE
stack	CODE
overflow	CODE
but	CODE
maybe	CODE
readers	CODE
will	CODE
find	CODE
some	CODE
use	CODE
for	CODE
it	CODE
-	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
way	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
of	CODE
because	CODE
of	CODE
leap	CODE
years	CODE
and	CODE
everything	CODE
is	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
helps	CODE
another	CODE
function	CODE
not	CODE
my	CODE
me	CODE
but	CODE
found	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
web	CODE
and	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
refined	CODE
just	CODE
two	CODE
things	CODE
that	CODE
come	CODE
into	CODE
my	CODE
mind	CODE
what	CODE
about	CODE
people	CODE
from	CODE
countries	CODE
that	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
gregorian	CODE
calendar	CODE
datetimenow	CODE
is	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
server-specific	CODE
culture	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
absolutely	CODE
0	CODE
knowledge	CODE
about	CODE
actually	CODE
working	CODE
with	CODE
asian	CODE
calendars	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
easy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
dates	CODE
between	CODE
calendars	CODE
but	CODE
just	CODE
in	CODE
case	CODE
you're	CODE
wondering	CODE
about	CODE
those	CODE
chinese	CODE
guys	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
year	CODE
4660	CODE
-	CODE
for	CODE
some	CODE
reason	CODE
jeff's	CODE
code	CODE
didn't	CODE
seem	CODE
simple	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
this	CODE
seems	CODE
simpler	CODE
and	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
understand	CODE
however	CODE
this	CODE
assumes	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
western	CODE
idea	CODE
of	CODE
age	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
using	CODE
east	CODE
asian	CODE
reckoning	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
version	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
here	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
and	CODE
it's	CODE
fairly	CODE
simple	CODE
it's	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
idea	CODE
as	CODE
jeff's	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
clearer	CODE
because	CODE
it	CODE
separates	CODE
out	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
for	CODE
subtracting	CODE
one	CODE
so	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
understand	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
expand	CODE
the	CODE
ternary	CODE
operator	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
even	CODE
clearer	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
thing	CODE
is	CODE
unclear	CODE
obviously	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
done	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
on	CODE
datetime	CODE
but	CODE
clearly	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
grab	CODE
that	CODE
one	CODE
line	CODE
of	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
does	CODE
the	CODE
work	CODE
and	CODE
put	CODE
it	CODE
anywhere	CODE
here	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
another	CODE
overload	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
extension	CODE
method	CODE
that	CODE
passes	CODE
in	CODE
datetimenow	CODE
just	CODE
for	CODE
completeness	CODE
some	CODE
object	CODE
suppose	CODE
the	CODE
dispose	CODE
method	CODE
which	CODE
forces	CODE
the	CODE
resource	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
removed	CODE
from	CODE
memory	CODE
no	CODE
don't	CODE
null	CODE

you	CODE

for	CODE
more	CODE

setting	CODE
things	CODE

null	CODE
won't	CODE
do	CODE
anything	CODE
except	CODE

your	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
time	CODE
you	CODE
should	CODE
set	CODE
a	CODE

is	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE

not	CODE

you	CODE
no	CODE

the	CODE

otherwise	CODE

no	CODE

some	CODE
cases	CODE
where	CODE
it	CODE
makes	CODE
sense	CODE
to	CODE
null	CODE
references	CODE
for	CODE
instance	CODE
when	CODE
you're	CODE
writing	CODE
a	CODE
collection--like	CODE
a	CODE
priority	CODE
queue--and	CODE
by	CODE
your	CODE
contract	CODE
you	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
be	CODE
keeping	CODE
those	CODE
objects	CODE
alive	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
after	CODE
the	CODE
client	CODE
has	CODE
removed	CODE
them	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
queue	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
thing	CODE
only	CODE
matters	CODE
in	CODE
long	CODE
lived	CODE
collections	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE

not	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
survive	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
function	CODE
it	CODE
was	CODE
created	CODE
in	CODE
then	CODE
it	CODE
matters	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
lot	CODE
less	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
whole	CODE
you	CODE
really	CODE
shouldn't	CODE
bother	CODE
let	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE

do	CODE
their	CODE
jobs	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
yours	CODE
karl	CODE
is	CODE
absolutely	CODE
correct	CODE
there	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
set	CODE
objects	CODE
to	CODE
null	CODE
after	CODE
use	CODE
if	CODE
an	CODE

just	CODE
make	CODE

you	CODE
call	CODE

wrapped	CODE

ever	CODE
used	CODE

i'm	CODE
so	CODE
motivated	CODE
i	CODE
may	CODE
pull	CODE

edit	CODE

here	CODE

two	CODE

that	CODE
compress	CODE

decompress	CODE
a	CODE

your	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE
subsitute	CODE
gzipstream	CODE
for	CODE
defaultstream	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
methods	CODE
below	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
that	CODE
algorithm	CODE
this	CODE
still	CODE
leaves	CODE
the	CODE
problem	CODE
of	CODE
handling	CODE
files	CODE
compressed	CODE
with	CODE
different	CODE
algorithms	CODE
though	CODE
can	CODE
you	CODE
show	CODE
us	CODE
your	CODE
code	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
python	CODE
docs	CODE
is	CODE
quite	CODE
straightforward	CODE
so	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
case	CODE
data	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
nodes	CODE
keyfunc	CODE
is	CODE
where	CODE
the	CODE
logic	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE
criteria	CODE
function	CODE
goes	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
groupby	CODE
groups	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
you	CODE
must	CODE
be	CODE
careful	CODE
to	CODE
sort	CODE
the	CODE
data	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
criteria	CODE
before	CODE
you	CODE
call	CODE
groupby	CODE
or	CODE
it	CODE
won't	CODE
work	CODE
groupby	CODE
method	CODE
actually	CODE
just	CODE
iterates	CODE
through	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
whenever	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
changes	CODE
it	CODE
creates	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
group	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
solution	CODE
in	CODE
sql	CODE
user	CODE
defined	CODE
function	CODE
to	CODE
parse	CODE
a	CODE
delimited	CODE
string	CODE
helpful	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
project	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE
this	CODE
simple	CODE
logic	CODE
well	CODE
mine	CODE
isn't	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
simpler	CODE
but	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
to	CODE
split	CODE
a	CODE
comma-delimited	CODE
input	CODE
variable	CODE
into	CODE
individual	CODE
values	CODE
and	CODE
put	CODE
it	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
table	CODE
variable	CODE
i'm	CODE
sure	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
modify	CODE
this	CODE
slightly	CODE
to	CODE
split	CODE
based	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
space	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
a	CODE
basic	CODE
select	CODE
query	CODE
against	CODE
that	CODE
table	CODE
variable	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
your	CODE
results	CODE
the	CODE
concept	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
much	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
one	CODE
other	CODE
alternative	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
leverage	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
compatibility	CODE
within	CODE
sql	CODE
server	CODE
2005	CODE
itself	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
essentially	CODE
write	CODE
yourself	CODE
a	CODE
simple	CODE
method	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
split	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
expose	CODE
that	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
stored	CODE
procedurefunction	CODE
here	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
udf	CODE
which	CODE
will	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE
table	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
delimited	CODE
values	CODE
haven't	CODE
tried	CODE
all	CODE
scenarios	CODE
on	CODE
it	CODE
but	CODE
your	CODE
example	CODE
works	CODE
fine	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
call	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
edit	CODE
updated	CODE
solution	CODE
to	CODE
handle	CODE
delimters	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
len1	CODE
as	CODE
in	CODE
try	CODE
this	CODE
test	CODE
it	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
believe	CODE
sql	CODE
server	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
built-in	CODE
split	CODE
function	CODE
so	CODE
other	CODE
than	CODE
a	CODE
udf	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
other	CODE
answer	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
hijack	CODE
the	CODE
parsename	CODE
function	CODE
parsename	CODE
takes	CODE
a	CODE
string	CODE
and	CODE
splits	CODE
it	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
period	CODE
character	CODE
it	CODE
takes	CODE
a	CODE
number	CODE
as	CODE
its	CODE
second	CODE
argument	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
number	CODE
specifies	CODE
which	CODE
segment	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
to	CODE
return	CODE
working	CODE
from	CODE
back	CODE
to	CODE
front	CODE
obvious	CODE
problem	CODE
is	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
string	CODE
already	CODE
contains	CODE
a	CODE
period	CODE
i	CODE
still	CODE
think	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
udf	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
wayany	CODE
other	CODE
suggestions	CODE
first	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
using	CODE
cte	CODE
common	CODE
table	CODE
expression	CODE
does	CODE
away	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
need	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
temp	CODE
table	CODE
then	CODE
use	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
any	CODE
table	CODE
or	CODE
modify	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
fit	CODE
within	CODE
your	CODE
existing	CODE
stored	CODE
proc	CODE
like	CODE
this	CODE
update	CODE
previous	CODE
version	CODE
would	CODE
fail	CODE
for	CODE
input	CODE
string	CODE
longer	CODE
than	CODE
4000	CODE
chars	CODE
this	CODE
version	CODE
takes	CODE
care	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
limitation	CODE
usage	CODE
remains	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
the	CODE
reason	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
generic	CODE
class	CODE
like	CODE
list	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
most	CODE
purposes	CODE
treated	CODE
externally	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
normal	CODE
class	CODE
eg	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
say	CODE
liststring	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
says	CODE
liststring	CODE
which	CODE
contains	CODE
strings	CODE
[technical	CODE
folk	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
an	CODE
extremely	CODE
plain-english-ified	CODE
version	CODE
of	CODE
what's	CODE
going	CODE
on]	CODE
consequently	CODE
obviously	CODE
the	CODE
compiler	CODE
can't	CODE
be	CODE
smart	CODE
enough	CODE
to	CODE
convert	CODE
a	CODE
liststring	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
listobject	CODE
by	CODE
casting	CODE
the	CODE
items	CODE
of	CODE
its	CODE
internal	CODE
collection	CODE
that's	CODE
why	CODE
there's	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
for	CODE
ienumerable	CODE
like	CODE
convert	CODE
that	CODE
allow	CODE
you	CODE
to	CODE
easily	CODE
supply	CODE
conversion	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
items	CODE
stored	CODE
inside	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
which	CODE
could	CODE
be	CODE
as	CODE
simple	CODE
as	CODE
casting	CODE
from	CODE
one	CODE
to	CODE
another	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
it	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
cast	CODE
and	CODE
then	CODE
add	CODE
an	CODE
object	CODE
of	CODE
type	CODE
foo	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
strings	CODE
is	CODE
no	CODE
longer	CODE
consistent	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
to	CODE
iterate	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
reference	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
class	CODE
cast	CODE
exception	CODE
because	CODE
once	CODE
you	CODE
hit	CODE
the	CODE
foo	CODE
instance	CODE
the	CODE
foo	CODE
could	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
converted	CODE
to	CODE
string	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
side	CODE
note	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
more	CODE
significant	CODE
whether	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
the	CODE
reverse	CODE
cast	CODE
i	CODE
haven't	CODE
used	CODE
c#	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
while	CODE
so	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
if	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
legal	CODE
but	CODE
that	CODE
sort	CODE
of	CODE
cast	CODE
is	CODE
actually	CODE
potentially	CODE
useful	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
going	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
general	CODE
class	CODE
object	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
specific	CODE
class	CODE
string	CODE
that	CODE
extends	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
general	CODE
one	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
way	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
add	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
strings	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
violating	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
does	CODE
anybody	CODE
know	CODE
or	CODE
can	CODE
test	CODE
if	CODE
such	CODE
a	CODE
cast	CODE
is	CODE
legal	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
mike	CODE
-	CODE
i	CODE
believe	CODE
contravariance	CODE
isn't	CODE
allowed	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
either	CODE
see	CODE
generic	CODE
type	CODE
parameter	CODE
variance	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE

for	CODE
some	CODE
more	CODE
info	CODE
this	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
with	CODE
covariance	CODE
eg	CODE
generic	CODE
types	CODE
are	CODE
considered	CODE
as	CODE
parameters	CODE
and	CODE
if	CODE
the	CODE
parameters	CODE
do	CODE
not	CODE
resolve	CODE
properly	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
specific	CODE
type	CODE
then	CODE
the	CODE
operation	CODE
fails	CODE
the	CODE
implication	CODE
of	CODE
such	CODE
is	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
really	CODE
cannot	CODE
cast	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
more	CODE
general	CODE
type	CODE
like	CODE
object	CODE
and	CODE
as	CODE

you	CODE

i	CODE
think	CODE
it's	CODE
either	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE

handle	CODE

search	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
name	CODE
of	CODE
your	CODE

once	CODE
the	CODE
handles	CODE
is	CODE
found	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
forcibly	CODE
close	CODE
them	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
then	CODE
delete	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
so	CODE
on	CODE
beware	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
may	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
program	CODE
which	CODE
owns	CODE
the	CODE

to	CODE
behave	CODE
strangely	CODE
as	CODE
you've	CODE
just	CODE
pulled	CODE
the	CODE
proverbial	CODE
rug	CODE
out	CODE
from	CODE

it	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
works	CODE
well	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE

debugging	CODE
your	CODE

when	CODE
visual	CODE

ages	CODE

sigh	CODE
-	CODE
oh	CODE
one	CODE
big	CODE
hack	CODE
i	CODE
employed	CODE
years	CODE

is	CODE
that	CODE
windows	CODE
won't	CODE

you	CODE

it	CODE
does	CODE
let	CODE
you	CODE
move	CODE
them	CODE
pseudo-sort-of-code	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
applications	CODE
restarted	CODE
note	CODE
we	CODE
didn't	CODE
need	CODE

the	CODE
machine	CODE
they	CODE
loaded	CODE
the	CODE

all	CODE
was	CODE

that	CODE

old	CODE
one	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
time	CODE
the	CODE
whole	CODE
system	CODE
restarted	CODE
worked	CODE
pretty	CODE
well	CODE
the	CODE
typical	CODE
method	CODE
is	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
you've	CODE
said	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
so	CODE
here	CODE
goes	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
know	CODE
which	CODE
process	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
locked	CODE
you'll	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
examine	CODE
each	CODE
process's	CODE
handle	CODE
list	CODE
and	CODE
query	CODE
each	CODE
handle	CODE
to	CODE
determine	CODE
if	CODE
it	CODE
identifies	CODE
the	CODE
locked	CODE
file	CODE
doing	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
will	CODE
likely	CODE
require	CODE
pinvoke	CODE
or	CODE
an	CODE
intermediary	CODE
c++cli	CODE
to	CODE
call	CODE
the	CODE
native	CODE
apis	CODE
you'll	CODE
need	CODE
once	CODE
you've	CODE
figured	CODE
out	CODE
which	CODE
processes	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
locked	CODE
you'll	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
safely	CODE
inject	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
native	CODE
dll	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
process	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
also	CODE
inject	CODE
a	CODE
managed	CODE
dll	CODE
but	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
messier	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
then	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
start	CODE
or	CODE
attach	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
net	CODE
runtime	CODE
that	CODE
bootstrap	CODE
dll	CODE
then	CODE
closes	CODE
the	CODE
handle	CODE
using	CODE
closehandle	CODE
etc	CODE
essentially	CODE
the	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
unlock	CODE
a	CODE
locked	CODE
file	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
inject	CODE
a	CODE
dll	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
offending	CODE
process's	CODE
address	CODE
space	CODE
and	CODE
close	CODE
it	CODE
yourself	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
using	CODE
native	CODE
or	CODE
managed	CODE
code	CODE
no	CODE
matter	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
need	CODE
a	CODE
small	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
native	CODE
code	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
least	CODE
pinvoke	CODE
into	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
helpful	CODE

good	CODE
luck	CODE
someone	CODE
correct	CODE
me	CODE
if	CODE
i'm	CODE
wrong	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
think	CODE
that	CODE
appsettings	CODE
is	CODE
typically	CODE
meant	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
these	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
configuration	CODE
settings	CODE
normally	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
only	CODE
put	CODE
in	CODE
settings	CODE
that	CODE
remain	CODE
fairly	CODE
static	CODE
database	CODE
connection	CODE
strings	CODE
file	CODE
paths	CODE
etc	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
customizable	CODE
user	CODE
settings	CODE
it	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
better	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
a	CODE
separate	CODE
preferences	CODE
file	CODE
or	CODE
ideally	CODE
store	CODE
those	CODE
settings	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
could	CODE
i	CODE
ask	CODE
why	CODE
you're	CODE
not	CODE
saving	CODE
the	CODE
user's	CODE
settings	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
generally	CODE
i	CODE
save	CODE
application	CODE
settings	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
changed	CODE
very	CODE
infrequently	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
section	CODE
the	CODE
default	CODE
email	CODE
address	CODE
error	CODE
logs	CODE
are	CODE
sent	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
minutes	CODE
after	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
automatically	CODE
logged	CODE
out	CODE
etc	CODE
the	CODE
scope	CODE
of	CODE
this	CODE
really	CODE
is	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
not	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
user	CODE
and	CODE
is	CODE
generally	CODE
used	CODE
for	CODE
deployment	CODE
settings	CODE
one	CODE
thing	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
doing	CODE
is	CODE
caching	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
read	CODE
then	CODE
flushing	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
from	CODE
the	CODE
cache	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
write	CODE
which	CODE
should	CODE
minimize	CODE
the	CODE
amount	CODE
of	CODE
actual	CODE
load	CODE
the	CODE
server	CODE
has	CODE
to	CODE
deal	CODE
with	CODE
for	CODE
processing	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
also	CODE
if	CODE
possible	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
breaking	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
up	CODE
into	CODE
configsections	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
read	CODE
write	CODE
and	CODE
cache	CODE
related	CODE
settings	CODE
having	CODE
said	CODE
all	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
seriously	CODE
consider	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
storing	CODE
these	CODE
values	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
actually	CODE
be	CODE
storing	CODE
user	CODE
preferences	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
application	CODE
settings	CODE
i	CODE
should	CODE
probably	CODE
clarify	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
points	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
not	CODE
a	CODE
web	CODE
application	CODE
so	CODE
connecting	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
overkill	CODE
simply	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
configuration	CODE
settings	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
windows	CODE
forms	CODE
application	CODE
according	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
msdn	CODE
documention	CODE
the	CODE
configurationmanager	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
not	CODE
just	CODE
application	CODE
level	CODE
settings	CODE
but	CODE
user	CODE
settings	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
especially	CODE
important	CODE
if	CODE
for	CODE
instance	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
is	CODE
installed	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
partial-trust	CODE
application	CODE
check	CODE
out	CODE
sqlite	CODE
it	CODE
seems	CODE
like	CODE
a	CODE
good	CODE
option	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
particular	CODE
scenario	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
not	CODE
use	CODE
config	CODE
files	CODE
for	CODE
storing	CODE
user	CODE
data	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
db	CODE
since	CODE
you're	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
winforms	CODE
app	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
in	CODE
net	CODE
20	CODE
there's	CODE
actually	CODE
a	CODE
user	CODE
settings	CODE
system	CODE
called	CODE
properties	CODE
that	CODE
is	CODE
designed	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
purpose	CODE
this	CODE
article	CODE
on	CODE
msdn	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
good	CODE
introduction	CODE
into	CODE
this	CODE
if	CODE
you're	CODE
still	CODE
worried	CODE
about	CODE
performance	CODE
then	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
sql	CODE
compact	CODE
edition	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
similar	CODE
to	CODE
sqlite	CODE
but	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft	CODE
offering	CODE
which	CODE
i've	CODE
found	CODE
plays	CODE
very	CODE
nicely	CODE
with	CODE
winforms	CODE
and	CODE
there's	CODE
even	CODE
the	CODE
ability	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
it	CODE
work	CODE
with	CODE
linq	CODE
dylan	CODE
don't	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
application	CODE
config	CODE
file	CODE
for	CODE
this	CODE
purpose	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
sql	CODE
db	CODE
sqlite	CODE
mysql	CODE
mssql	CODE
whatever	CODE
because	CODE
you'll	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
worry	CODE
less	CODE
about	CODE
concurrency	CODE
issues	CODE
during	CODE
reads	CODE
and	CODE
writes	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
config	CODE
file	CODE
you'll	CODE
also	CODE
have	CODE
better	CODE
flexibility	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
type	CODE
of	CODE
data	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
section	CODE
is	CODE
just	CODE
a	CODE
keyvalue	CODE
list	CODE
which	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
outgrow	CODE
as	CODE
time	CODE
passes	CODE
and	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
app	CODE
matures	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
custom	CODE
config	CODE
sections	CODE
but	CODE
then	CODE
you're	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
problem	CODE
area	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
comes	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
design	CODE
the	CODE
appsettings	CODE
isn't	CODE
really	CODE
meant	CODE
for	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
when	CODE
your	CODE
net	CODE
application	CODE
starts	CODE
it	CODE
reads	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
appconfig	CODE
file	CODE
and	CODE
caches	CODE
its	CODE
contents	CODE
in	CODE
memory	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
reason	CODE
after	CODE
you	CODE
write	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
appconfig	CODE
file	CODE
you'll	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
somehow	CODE
force	CODE
the	CODE
runtime	CODE
to	CODE
re-parse	CODE
the	CODE
appconfig	CODE
file	CODE
so	CODE
it	CODE
can	CODE
cache	CODE
the	CODE
settings	CODE
again	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
unnecessary	CODE
the	CODE
best	CODE
approach	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
to	CODE
store	CODE
your	CODE
configuration	CODE
settings	CODE
barring	CODE
the	CODE
use	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
database	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
easily	CODE
setup	CODE
an	CODE
external	CODE
xml	CODE
configuration	CODE
file	CODE
when	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
starts	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
cache	CODE
its	CODE
contents	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
namevaluecollection	CODE
object	CODE
or	CODE
hashtable	CODE
object	CODE
as	CODE
you	CODE
changeadd	CODE
settings	CODE
you	CODE
would	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
that	CODE
cached	CODE
copy	CODE
when	CODE
your	CODE
application	CODE
shuts	CODE
down	CODE
or	CODE
at	CODE
an	CODE
appropriate	CODE
time	CODE
interval	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
write	CODE
the	CODE
cache	CODE
contents	CODE
back	CODE
out	CODE
to	CODE
file	CODE
it	CODE
might	CODE
be	CODE
worth	CODE
checking	CODE
out	CODE
what	CODE
some	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
other	CODE
guys	CODE
are	CODE
doing	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
space	CODE
and	CODE
not	CODE
necessarily	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
c#	CODE
arena	CODE
either	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
library	CODE
written	CODE
in	CODE
c#	CODE
svn	CODE
also	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
binary	CODE
diff	CODE
algorithm	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
know	CODE
there's	CODE
an	CODE
implementation	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
although	CODE
i	CODE
couldn't	CODE
find	CODE
it	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
quick	CODE
search	CODE
they	CODE
might	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
some	CODE
ideas	CODE
on	CODE
where	CODE
to	CODE
improve	CODE
your	CODE
own	CODE
algorithm	CODE
sorry	CODE
i	CODE
couldn't	CODE
be	CODE
more	CODE
help	CODE
i	CODE
would	CODE
definately	CODE
keep	CODE
looking	CODE
at	CODE
xdelta	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
used	CODE
it	CODE
a	CODE
number	CODE
of	CODE
times	CODE
to	CODE
produce	CODE
quality	CODE
diffs	CODE
on	CODE
600mb+	CODE
iso	CODE
files	CODE
we	CODE
have	CODE
generated	CODE
for	CODE
distributing	CODE
our	CODE
products	CODE
and	CODE
it	CODE
performs	CODE
very	CODE
well	CODE
if	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
for	CODE
installation	CODE
or	CODE
distribution	CODE
have	CODE
you	CODE
considered	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
windows	CODE
installer	CODE
sdk	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
the	CODE
ability	CODE
to	CODE
patch	CODE
binary	CODE
files	CODE
yes	CODE
they	CODE
should	CODE
only	CODE
leads	CODE
to	CODE
confusion	CODE
otherwise	CODE
i'd	CODE
say	CODE
yes	CODE
first	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
actual	CODE
code	CODE
files	CODE
by	CODE
following	CODE
down	CODE
the	CODE
namespaces	CODE
say	CODE
when	CODE
somebody	CODE
e-mails	CODE
you	CODE
a	CODE
naked	CODE
exception	CODE
call	CODE
stack	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
let	CODE
your	CODE
folders	CODE
go	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
sync	CODE
with	CODE
namespaces	CODE
finding	CODE
files	CODE
in	CODE
big	CODE
codebases	CODE
becomes	CODE
getting	CODE
tiring	CODE
second	CODE
vs	CODE
will	CODE
generate	CODE
new	CODE
classes	CODE
you	CODE
create	CODE
in	CODE
folders	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
namespace	CODE
of	CODE
its	CODE
parent	CODE
folder	CODE
structure	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
decide	CODE
to	CODE
swim	CODE
against	CODE
this	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
just	CODE
one	CODE
more	CODE
plumbing	CODE
job	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
daily	CODE
when	CODE
adding	CODE
new	CODE
files	CODE
of	CODE
course	CODE
this	CODE
goes	CODE
without	CODE
saying	CODE
that	CODE
one	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
conservative	CODE
about	CODE
how	CODE
deep	CODE
xis	CODE
foldernamespace	CODE
hierarchy	CODE
goes	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
the	CODE
standard	CODE
within	CODE
net	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
try	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
it	CODE
when	CODE
possible	CODE
but	CODE
not	CODE
to	CODE
create	CODE
unnecessarily	CODE
deep	CODE
structures	CODE
just	CODE
to	CODE
adhere	CODE
to	CODE
it	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
hard	CODE
rule	CODE
none	CODE
of	CODE
my	CODE
projects	CODE
follow	CODE
the	CODE
namespace	CODE
==	CODE
structure	CODE
rule	CODE
100%	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
sometimes	CODE
its	CODE
just	CODE
cleanerbetter	CODE
to	CODE
break	CODE
out	CODE
from	CODE
such	CODE
rules	CODE
in	CODE
java	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
choice	CODE
i'd	CODE
call	CODE
that	CODE
a	CODE
classic	CODE
case	CODE
of	CODE
what	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE
theory	CODE
vs	CODE
what	CODE
works	CODE
in	CODE
practice	CODE
also	CODE
note	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
built-in	CODE
templates	CODE
to	CODE
add	CODE
classes	CODE
to	CODE
a	CODE
folder	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
by	CODE
default	CODE
be	CODE
put	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
namespace	CODE
that	CODE
reflects	CODE
the	CODE
folder	CODE
hierarchy	CODE
the	CODE
classes	CODE
will	CODE
be	CODE
easier	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
and	CODE
that	CODE
alone	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
reasons	CODE
good	CODE
enough	CODE
the	CODE
rules	CODE
we	CODE
follow	CODE
are	CODE
projectassembly	CODE
name	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
as	CODE
the	CODE
root	CODE
namespace	CODE
except	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
dll	CODE
ending	CODE
only	CODE
exception	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
above	CODE
rule	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
project	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
core	CODE
ending	CODE
the	CODE
core	CODE
is	CODE
stripped	CODE
off	CODE
folders	CODE
equals	CODE
namespaces	CODE
one	CODE
type	CODE
per	CODE
file	CODE
class	CODE
struct	CODE
enum	CODE
delegate	CODE
etc	CODE
makes	CODE
it	CODE
easy	CODE
to	CODE
find	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
file	CODE
i	CODE
found	CODE
that	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
append	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
modified	CODE
timestamp	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
onto	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
url	CODE
the	CODE
browser	CODE
will	CODE
request	CODE
the	CODE
files	CODE
when	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
modified	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
in	CODE
php	CODE
some	CODE
solutions	CODE
i	CODE
have	CODE
seen	CODE
involve	CODE
adding	CODE
a	CODE
version	CODE
number	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
form	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
query	CODE
string	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
svn	CODE
revision	CODE
number	CODE
to	CODE
automate	CODE
this	CODE
for	CODE
you	CODE
by	CODE
including	CODE
the	CODE
word	CODE
lastchangedrevision	CODE
in	CODE
your	CODE
html	CODE
file	CODE
after	CODE
where	CODE
v1	CODE
appears	CODE
above	CODE
you	CODE
must	CODE
also	CODE
setup	CODE
your	CODE
repository	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
i	CODE
hope	CODE
this	CODE
further	CODE
clarifies	CODE
my	CODE
answer	CODE
firefox	CODE
also	CODE
allows	CODE
pressing	CODE
ctrl	CODE
+	CODE
r	CODE
to	CODE
reload	CODE
everything	CODE
on	CODE
a	CODE
particular	CODE
page	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
opinion	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
better	CODE
to	CODE
make	CODE
the	CODE
version	CODE
number	CODE
part	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
file	CODE
itself	CODE
eg	CODE
myscript123js	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
set	CODE
your	CODE
webserver	CODE
to	CODE
cache	CODE
this	CODE
file	CODE
forever	CODE
and	CODE
just	CODE
add	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
js	CODE
file	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
version	CODE
is	CODE
this	CODE
a	CODE
console	CODE
app	CODE
or	CODE
a	CODE
winforms	CODE
app	CODE
if	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
net	CODE
11	CODE
console	CODE
app	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
sadly	CODE
by	CODE
design	CODE
--	CODE
it's	CODE
confirmed	CODE
by	CODE
a	CODE
msft	CODE
dev	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
blog	CODE
post	CODE
you	CODE
referenced	CODE
btw	CODE
on	CODE
my	CODE
11	CODE
machine	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
from	CODE
msdn	CODE
does	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
expected	CODE
output	CODE
it's	CODE
just	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
line	CODE
doesn't	CODE
show	CODE
up	CODE
until	CODE
after	CODE
you've	CODE
attached	CODE
a	CODE
debugger	CODE
or	CODE
not	CODE
in	CODE
v2	CODE
we've	CODE
flipped	CODE
things	CODE
around	CODE
so	CODE
that	CODE
the	CODE
unhandledexception	CODE
event	CODE
fires	CODE
before	CODE
the	CODE
debugger	CODE
attaches	CODE
which	CODE
seems	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
what	CODE
most	CODE
people	CODE
expect	CODE
sounds	CODE
like	CODE
net	CODE
20	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
better	CODE
thank	CODE
goodness	CODE
but	CODE
honestly	CODE
i	CODE
never	CODE
had	CODE
time	CODE
to	CODE
go	CODE
back	CODE
and	CODE
check	CODE
it's	CODE
a	CODE
winforms	CODE
app	CODE
the	CODE
exceptions	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
caught	CODE
by	CODE
applicationthreadexception	CODE
work	CODE
fine	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
don't	CODE
get	CODE
the	CODE
ugly	CODE
net	CODE
exception	CODE
box	CODE
ok	CODE
to	CODE
terminate	CODE
cancel	CODE
to	CODE
debug	CODE
who	CODE
came	CODE
up	CODE
with	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
getting	CODE
some	CODE
exceptions	CODE
that	CODE
weren't	CODE
being	CODE
caught	CODE
by	CODE
that	CODE
and	CODE
ended	CODE
up	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
appdomainunhandledexception	CODE
event	CODE
that	CODE
were	CODE
causing	CODE
problems	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
i've	CODE
caught	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
those	CODE
exceptions	CODE
and	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
displaying	CODE
them	CODE
in	CODE
our	CODE
nice	CODE
error	CODE
box	CODE
now	CODE
so	CODE
i'll	CODE
just	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
hope	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
not	CODE
some	CODE
other	CODE
circumstances	CODE
that	CODE
would	CODE
cause	CODE
exceptions	CODE
to	CODE
not	CODE
be	CODE
caught	CODE
by	CODE
the	CODE
applicationthreadexception	CODE
handler	CODE
oh	CODE
in	CODE
winforms	CODE
you	CODE
definitely	CODE
should	CODE
be	CODE
able	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
it	CODE
to	CODE
work	CODE
the	CODE
only	CODE
thing	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
watch	CODE
out	CODE

an	CODE

appdomainunhandledexception	CODE

i	CODE
believe	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
looking	CODE
for	CODE
yes	CODE
i	CODE
thought	CODE
about	CODE
that	CODE

i	CODE
soon	CODE
figured	CODE
out	CODE
that	CODE
another	CODE
domain-specific-language	CODE

would	CODE
be	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
too	CODE
much	CODE
essentially	CODE
they	CODE
need	CODE
to	CODE
interact	CODE
with	CODE
my	CODE
gamestate	CODE
in	CODE
possibly	CODE
unpredictable	CODE
ways	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
a	CODE
card	CODE
could	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
rule	CODE
when	CODE
this	CODE
cards	CODE
enter	CODE
play	CODE
all	CODE
your	CODE
undead	CODE
minions	CODE
gain	CODE
+3	CODE
attack	CODE
against	CODE
flying	CODE
enemies	CODE
except	CODE
when	CODE
the	CODE
enemy	CODE
is	CODE
blessed	CODE
as	CODE
trading	CODE
card	CODE
games	CODE
are	CODE
turn	CODE
based	CODE
the	CODE
gamestate	CODE
manager	CODE
will	CODE
fire	CODE
onstagex	CODE
events	CODE
and	CODE
let	CODE
the	CODE
cards	CODE
modify	CODE

would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
consider	CODE

is	CODE
specifically	CODE
built	CODE
for	CODE
scripting	CODE
such	CODE

otherwise	CODE
i'd	CODE
suggest	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE

where	CODE
you	CODE
place	CODE
precompiled	CODE

then	CODE
you	CODE

you	CODE

however	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE

you	CODE

heart's	CODE
content	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
don't	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE
use	CODE

you	CODE
could	CODE
consider	CODE
the	CODE

with	CODE
the	CODE

you	CODE
can	CODE

using	CODE
the	CODE

boo	CODE
makes	CODE
a	CODE
nice	CODE
scripting	CODE
language	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
flexible	CODE
syntax	CODE
and	CODE
an	CODE
extensible	CODE
language	CODE
via	CODE
its	CODE
open	CODE
compiler	CODE
architecture	CODE
scriptnet	CODE
looks	CODE
nice	CODE
too	CODE
though	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
easily	CODE
extend	CODE
that	CODE
language	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
as	CODE
its	CODE
an	CODE
open	CODE
source	CODE
project	CODE
and	CODE
uses	CODE
a	CODE
very	CODE
friendly	CODE
compiler	CODE
generator	CODE
ironynet	CODE
as	CODE
far	CODE
as	CODE
i	CODE
can	CODE
tell	CODE
python	CODE
up	CODE
through	CODE
25	CODE
only	CODE
supports	CODE
hexadecimal	CODE
octal	CODE

i	CODE
did	CODE
find	CODE
some	CODE
discussions	CODE
about	CODE
adding	CODE

but	CODE
nothing	CODE
definite	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
pretty	CODE
sure	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
things	CODE
due	CODE
to	CODE
change	CODE
in	CODE

edit	CODE
lbrandy's	CODE
answer	CODE
is	CODE
correct	CODE
in	CODE
all	CODE
cases	CODE
another	CODE
way	CODE
break	CODE
would	CODE
stop	CODE
the	CODE
foreach	CODE
loop	CODE
completely	CODE
continue	CODE
would	CODE
skip	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
datarow	CODE
break	CODE
will	CODE
exit	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
completely	CODE
continue	CODE
will	CODE
just	CODE
skip	CODE
the	CODE
current	CODE
iteration	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
the	CODE
break	CODE
will	CODE
cause	CODE
the	CODE
loop	CODE
to	CODE
exit	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
first	CODE
iteration	CODE
-	CODE
dosomethingwith	CODE
will	CODE
never	CODE
be	CODE
executed	CODE
this	CODE
here	CODE
will	CODE
not	CODE
execute	CODE
dosomethingwith	CODE

i	CODE

the	CODE

be	CODE
executed	CODE
for	CODE
i	CODE

1	CODE
to	CODE
i	CODE

9	CODE
a	CODE
really	CODE
easy	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
understand	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
to	CODE
place	CODE
the	CODE
word	CODE
loop	CODE
after	CODE
each	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
keywords	CODE
the	CODE
terms	CODE
now	CODE
make	CODE
sense	CODE
if	CODE
they	CODE
are	CODE
just	CODE
read	CODE
like	CODE
everyday	CODE
phrases	CODE
break	CODE
loop	CODE
-	CODE
looping	CODE
is	CODE
broken	CODE
and	CODE
stops	CODE
continue	CODE
loop	CODE
-	CODE
loop	CODE
continues	CODE
to	CODE
execute	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
next	CODE
iteration	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
people	CODE
who	CODE
don't	CODE
like	CODE
break	CODE
and	CODE
continue	CODE
the	CODE
latest	CODE
complaint	CODE
i	CODE
saw	CODE
about	CODE
them	CODE
was	CODE
in	CODE
javascript	CODE
the	CODE
good	CODE
parts	CODE
by	CODE
douglas	CODE
crockford	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
find	CODE
that	CODE
sometimes	CODE
using	CODE
one	CODE
of	CODE
them	CODE
really	CODE
simplifies	CODE
things	CODE
especially	CODE
if	CODE
your	CODE
language	CODE
doesn't	CODE
include	CODE
a	CODE
do-while	CODE
or	CODE
do-until	CODE
style	CODE
of	CODE
loop	CODE
i	CODE
tend	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
break	CODE
in	CODE
loops	CODE
that	CODE
are	CODE
searching	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
for	CODE
something	CODE
once	CODE
found	CODE
there's	CODE
no	CODE
point	CODE
in	CODE
continuing	CODE
so	CODE
you	CODE
might	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
quit	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
continue	CODE
when	CODE
doing	CODE
something	CODE
with	CODE
most	CODE
elements	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
but	CODE
still	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
skip	CODE
over	CODE
a	CODE
few	CODE
the	CODE
break	CODE
statement	CODE
also	CODE
comes	CODE
in	CODE
handy	CODE
when	CODE
polling	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
valid	CODE
response	CODE
from	CODE
somebody	CODE
or	CODE
something	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
eliminate	CODE
some	CODE
duplication	CODE
and	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
do-until	CODE
loop	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
mentioned	CODE
before	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
more	CODE
elegant	CODE
solution	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
particular	CODE
problem	CODE
no	CODE
duplication	CODE
and	CODE
no	CODE
break	CODE
needed	CODE
either	CODE
ruby	CODE
unfortunately	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
different	CODE
ps	CODE
my	CODE
memory	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
hazy	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
so	CODE
apologies	CODE
if	CODE
i'm	CODE
wrong	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
breakcontinue	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
breaknext	CODE
which	CODE
behave	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
in	CODE
terms	CODE
of	CODE
loops	CODE
loops	CODE
like	CODE
everything	CODE
else	CODE
are	CODE
expressions	CODE
and	CODE
return	CODE
the	CODE
last	CODE
thing	CODE
that	CODE
they	CODE
did	CODE
most	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
time	CODE
getting	CODE
the	CODE
return	CODE
value	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
loop	CODE
is	CODE
pointless	CODE
so	CODE
everyone	CODE
just	CODE
does	CODE
this	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
however	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
however	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
ruby	CODE
code	CODE
'emulates'	CODE
a	CODE
loop	CODE
by	CODE
using	CODE
a	CODE
block	CODE
the	CODE
canonical	CODE
example	CODE
is	CODE
as	CODE
it	CODE
is	CODE
much	CODE
more	CODE
common	CODE
for	CODE
people	CODE
to	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
things	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
result	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
block	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
where	CODE
it	CODE
gets	CODE
messy	CODE
breaknext	CODE
mean	CODE
different	CODE
things	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
context	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
block	CODE
break	CODE
will	CODE
jump	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
that	CODE
called	CODE
the	CODE
block	CODE
next	CODE
will	CODE
skip	CODE
the	CODE
rest	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
code	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
block	CODE
and	CODE
'return'	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
specify	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
caller	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
block	CODE
this	CODE
doesn't	CODE
make	CODE
any	CODE
sense	CODE
without	CODE
examples	CODE
so	CODE
yeah	CODE
ruby	CODE
is	CODE
awesome	CODE
but	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
some	CODE
awful	CODE
corner-cases	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
worst	CODE
one	CODE
i've	CODE
seen	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
years	CODE
of	CODE
using	CODE
it	CODE
-	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
mbunit	CODE
er	CODE
gallio	CODE
most	CODE
importantly	CODE
to	CODE
me	CODE
is	CODE
having	CODE
good	CODE
tools	CODE
support	CODE
inside	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
for	CODE
that	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
resharper	CODE
which	CODE
has	CODE
an	CODE
mbunit	CODE
test	CODE
runner	CODE
a	CODE
lot	CODE
of	CODE
folks	CODE
seem	CODE
to	CODE
like	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
as	CODE
their	CODE
test	CODE
runner	CODE
as	CODE
well	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
even	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
use	CODE
resharper	CODE
and	CODE
i'm	CODE
pretty	CODE
happy	CODE
with	CODE
xunitnet	CODE
it	CODE
uses	CODE
facts	CODE
instead	CODE
of	CODE
tests	CODE
which	CODE
many	CODE
people	CODE
dislike	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
like	CODE
the	CODE
difference	CODE
in	CODE
terminology	CODE
it's	CODE
useful	CODE
to	CODE
think	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
collection	CODE
of	CODE
automatically	CODE
provable	CODE
facts	CODE
about	CODE
your	CODE
software	CODE
and	CODE
see	CODE
which	CODE
ones	CODE
you	CODE
violate	CODE
when	CODE
you	CODE
make	CODE
a	CODE
change	CODE
be	CODE
aware	CODE
that	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
2008	CODE
professional	CODE
and	CODE
above	CODE
now	CODE
comes	CODE
with	CODE
integrated	CODE
unit	CODE
testing	CODE
it	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
be	CODE
available	CODE
only	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
team	CODE
system	CODE
editions	CODE
and	CODE
may	CODE
be	CODE
suitable	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
needs	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
so	CODE
many	CODE
it's	CODE
crazy	CODE
crazy	CODE
good	CODE
i	CODE
guess	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
conservative	CODE
types	CODE
me	CODE
nunit	CODE
is	CODE
still	CODE
available	CODE
and	CODE
still	CODE
more	CODE
than	CODE
capable	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
microsoft-types	CODE
mstest	CODE
is	CODE
adequate	CODE
but	CODE
slow	CODE
and	CODE
clunky	CODE
compared	CODE
to	CODE
nunit	CODE
it	CODE
also	CODE
lacks	CODE
code	CODE
coverage	CODE
without	CODE
paying	CODE
the	CODE
big	CODE
bucks	CODE
for	CODE
the	CODE
pricey	CODE
versions	CODE
of	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
there's	CODE
also	CODE
mbunit	CODE
it's	CODE
like	CODE
nunit	CODE
but	CODE
has	CODE
nifty	CODE
features	CODE
like	CODE
rowtest	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
same	CODE
test	CODE
with	CODE
different	CODE
parameters	CODE
and	CODE
rollback	CODE
put	CODE
the	CODE
database	CODE
back	CODE
like	CODE
you	CODE
found	CODE
it	CODE
after	CODE
a	CODE
test	CODE
and	CODE
finally	CODE
xunitnet	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
trendy	CODE
option	CODE
with	CODE
some	CODE
attitude	CODE
oh	CODE
and	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
will	CODE
give	CODE
you	CODE
ide	CODE
integration	CODE
for	CODE
both	CODE
nunit	CODE
and	CODE
mbunit	CODE
i'm	CODE
sure	CODE
they're	CODE
all	CODE
just	CODE
fine	CODE
i'd	CODE
steer	CODE
away	CODE
from	CODE
mstest	CODE
though	CODE
unless	CODE
you	CODE
just	CODE
enjoy	CODE
the	CODE
convenience	CODE
of	CODE
having	CODE
everything	CODE
in	CODE
one	CODE
ide	CODE
out	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
box	CODE
scott	CODE
hanselman	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
podcast	CODE
on	CODE
this	CODE
very	CODE
topic	CODE
xunitnet	CODE
looks	CODE
like	CODE
it	CODE
provides	CODE
a	CODE
slightly	CODE
different	CODE
approach	CODE
to	CODE
nmbmsunit	CODE
which	CODE
is	CODE
interesting	CODE
in	CODE
my	CODE
search	CODE
for	CODE
an	CODE
rspec-like	CODE
solution	CODE
because	CODE
i	CODE
love	CODE
the	CODE
rspec	CODE
i	CODE
also	CODE
came	CODE
across	CODE
nspec	CODE
which	CODE
looks	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
wordy	CODE
but	CODE
combined	CODE
with	CODE
the	CODE
nspec	CODE
extensions	CODE
addon	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
c#3	CODE
extension	CODE
methods	CODE
it	CODE
looks	CODE
pretty	CODE
nice	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
nunit	CODE
and	CODE
mbunit	CODE
here	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
the	CODE
unit	CODE
tests	CODE
from	CODE
within	CODE
visual	CODE
studio	CODE
we	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
excellent	CODE
highly	CODE
recommended	CODE
rhinomocks	CODE
as	CODE
a	CODE
mock	CODE
framework	CODE
i	CODE
used	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
nunit	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
switched	CODE
to	CODE
mbunit	CODE
since	CODE
it	CODE
has	CODE
more	CODE
features	CODE
i	CODE
love	CODE
rowtest	CODE
it	CODE
lets	CODE
you	CODE
parametrize	CODE
your	CODE
tests	CODE
nunit	CODE
does	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
litter	CODE
bit	CODE
better	CODE
tool	CODE
support	CODE
though	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
using	CODE
resharper	CODE
to	CODE
run	CODE
mbunit	CODE
tests	CODE
i've	CODE
had	CODE
problems	CODE
with	CODE
testdrivennet	CODE
running	CODE
my	CODE
setup	CODE
methods	CODE
for	CODE
mbunit	CODE
no	CODE
you	CODE
were	CODE
not	CODE
dreaming	CODE
python	CODE
has	CODE
a	CODE
pretty	CODE
excellent	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
system	CODE
that	CODE
lets	CODE
you	CODE
manipulate	CODE
lists	CODE
pretty	CODE
elegantly	CODE
and	CODE
depending	CODE
on	CODE
exactly	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
want	CODE
to	CODE
accomplish	CODE
this	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
done	CODE
a	CODE
couple	CODE
of	CODE
ways	CODE
in	CODE
essence	CODE
what	CODE
you're	CODE
doing	CODE
is	CODE
saying	CODE
for	CODE
item	CODE
in	CODE
list	CODE
if	CODE
criteriamatches	CODE
and	CODE
from	CODE
that	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
just	CODE
iterate	CODE
through	CODE
the	CODE
results	CODE
or	CODE
dump	CODE
the	CODE
results	CODE
into	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
list	CODE
i'm	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
crib	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
from	CODE
dive	CODE
into	CODE
python	CODE
here	CODE
because	CODE
it's	CODE
pretty	CODE
elegant	CODE
and	CODE
they're	CODE
smarter	CODE
than	CODE
i	CODE
am	CODE
here	CODE
they're	CODE
getting	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
files	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
directory	CODE
then	CODE
filtering	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
for	CODE
all	CODE
files	CODE
that	CODE
match	CODE
a	CODE
regular	CODE
expression	CODE
criteria	CODE
you	CODE
could	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
without	CODE
regular	CODE
expressions	CODE
for	CODE
your	CODE
example	CODE
for	CODE
anything	CODE
where	CODE
your	CODE
expression	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
returns	CODE
true	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
match	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
other	CODE
options	CODE
like	CODE
using	CODE
the	CODE
filter	CODE
function	CODE
but	CODE
if	CODE
i	CODE
were	CODE
going	CODE
to	CODE
choose	CODE
i'd	CODE
go	CODE
with	CODE
this	CODE
eric	CODE
sipple	CODE
i	CODE
think	CODE
is	CODE
what	CODE
you	CODE
are	CODE
thinking	CODE
of	CODE
when	CODE
trying	CODE
to	CODE
see	CODE
if	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
key	CODE
exists	CODE
within	CODE
a	CODE
dictionary	CODE
in	CODE
python	CODE
python's	CODE
version	CODE
of	CODE
a	CODE
hash	CODE
table	CODE
there	CODE
are	CODE
two	CODE
ways	CODE
to	CODE
check	CODE
first	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
has_key	CODE
method	CODE
attached	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
dictionary	CODE
and	CODE
second	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
example	CODE
given	CODE
above	CODE
it	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
a	CODE
boolean	CODE
value	CODE
that	CODE
should	CODE
answer	CODE
your	CODE
question	CODE
and	CODE
now	CODE
a	CODE
little	CODE
off	CODE
topic	CODE
to	CODE
tie	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
to	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
answer	CODE
previously	CODE
given	CODE
for	CODE
a	CODE
bit	CODE
more	CODE
clarity	CODE
list	CODE
comprehensions	CODE
construct	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
from	CODE
a	CODE
basic	CODE
for	CODE
loop	CODE
with	CODE
modifiers	CODE
as	CODE
an	CODE
example	CODE
to	CODE
clarify	CODE
slightly	CODE
a	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
the	CODE
in	CODE
dict	CODE
language	CODE
construct	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
_list	CODE
comprehension_	CODE
say	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
two	CODE
dimensional	CODE
dictionary	CODE
foo	CODE
and	CODE
you	CODE
only	CODE
want	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
dimension	CODE
dictionaries	CODE
which	CODE
contain	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
bar	CODE
a	CODE
relatively	CODE
straightforward	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
so	CODE
would	CODE
be	CODE
to	CODE
use	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
with	CODE
a	CODE
conditional	CODE
as	CODE
follows	CODE
note	CODE
the	CODE
if	CODE
bar	CODE
in	CODE
value	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
end	CODE
of	CODE
the	CODE
statement	CODE
this	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
modifying	CODE
clause	CODE
which	CODE
tells	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
to	CODE
only	CODE
keep	CODE
those	CODE
key-value	CODE
pairs	CODE
which	CODE
meet	CODE
the	CODE
conditional	CODE
in	CODE
this	CODE
case	CODE
baz	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
new	CODE
dictionary	CODE
which	CODE
contains	CODE
only	CODE
the	CODE
dictionaries	CODE
from	CODE
foo	CODE
which	CODE
contain	CODE
bar	CODE
hopefully	CODE
i	CODE
didn't	CODE
miss	CODE
anything	CODE
in	CODE
that	CODE
code	CODE
example	CODE
you	CODE
may	CODE
have	CODE
to	CODE
take	CODE
a	CODE
look	CODE
at	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
documentation	CODE
found	CODE
in	CODE
docspythonorg	CODE
tutorials	CODE
and	CODE
at	CODE
secnetixde	CODE
both	CODE
sites	CODE
are	CODE
good	CODE
references	CODE
if	CODE
you	CODE
have	CODE
questions	CODE
in	CODE
the	CODE
future	CODE
are	CODE
you	CODE
looking	CODE
to	CODE
get	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
that	CODE
have	CODE
a	CODE
certain	CODE
attribute	CODE
if	CODE
so	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
is	CODE
the	CODE
right	CODE
way	CODE
to	CODE
do	CODE
this	CODE
what	CODE
i	CODE
was	CODE
thinking	CODE
of	CODE
can	CODE
be	CODE
achieved	CODE
using	CODE
list	CODE
comprehensions	CODE
but	CODE
i	CODE
thought	CODE
that	CODE
there	CODE
was	CODE
a	CODE
function	CODE
that	CODE
did	CODE
this	CODE
in	CODE
a	CODE
slightly	CODE
neater	CODE
way	CODE
ie	CODE
'bar'	CODE
is	CODE
a	CODE
list	CODE
of	CODE
objects	CODE
all	CODE
of	CODE
which	CODE
have	CODE
the	CODE
attribute	CODE
'id'	CODE
the	CODE
mythical	CODE
functional	CODE
way	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
way	CODE
in	CODE
retrospect	CODE
the	CODE
list	CODE
comprehension	CODE
way	CODE
is	CODE
pretty	CODE
neat	CODE
anyway	CODE
within	CODE
your	CODE
overridden	CODE
processcmdkey	CODE
how	CODE
are	CODE
you	CODE
determining	CODE
which	CODE
key	CODE
has	CODE
been	CODE
pressed	CODE
the	CODE
value	CODE
of	CODE
keydata	CODE
the	CODE
second	CODE
parameter	CODE
will	CODE
change	CODE
dependant	CODE
on	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
pressed	CODE
and	CODE
any	CODE
modifier	CODE
keys	CODE
so	CODE
for	CODE
example	CODE
pressing	CODE
the	CODE
left	CODE
arrow	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
code	CODE
37	CODE
shift-left	CODE
will	CODE
return	CODE
65573	CODE
ctrl-left	CODE
131109	CODE
and	CODE
alt-left	CODE
262181	CODE
you	CODE
can	CODE
extract	CODE
the	CODE
modifiers	CODE
and	CODE
the	CODE
key	CODE
pressed	CODE
by	CODE
